Eddie goes to heaven, where he meets five people who were unexpectedly instrumental in some way in his life. While each guide takes him through heaven, Eddie learns a little bit more about what his time on earth meant, what he was supposed to have learned, and what his true purpose on earth was. Throughout there are dramatic flashbacks where we see scenes from his troubled childhood, his years in the army in the Philippines jungle, and with his first and only love, his wife Marguerite.

{"id": "910927", "text": "A few thousand years in the future post-apocalypse rural Labrador has become a warmer, more hospitable place. The inhabitants have vague historical recollections of \"The Old People\", a technologically advanced civilization which existed long ago which they believe was destroyed when god sent \"Tribulation\" to the world to punish their forebears' sins. The society that has survived is loosely reminiscent of the American frontier of the 18th century. The inhabitants practice a form of fundamentalist Xianity with post-apocalyptic prohibitions. They believe that in order to follow god & prevent another Tribulation, they need to preserve absolute normality among the surviving humans, plants & animals. Genetic invariance has been elevated to the highest religious principle. Humans with even minor mutations are considered devilish \"Blasphemies\". Individuals not conforming to a strict physical norm are either killed or sterilized & banished to the Fringes, a forbidden area still rife with mutations. Arguments occur over the keeping of a tailless cat or the possession of oversize horses. These are deemed by the government to be legitimate breeds either preexisting or achieved through conventional breeding. The government's position is considered cynically heretical by the orthodox.\nThe inland rural settlement of Waknuk is a frontier farming community, populated with hardy & pious individuals intent on reclaiming land from the Fringes. Ten-year-old David Strorm, the son of Waknuk's zealous religious patriarch, has inexplicably vivid dreams of brightly lit cities & horseless carts that are at odds with his preindustrial experience. Despite David's rigorous religious training, he befriends Sophie, a girl carefully concealing the fact that she has six toes on each foot. With the nonchalance of childhood David keeps her secret. The subsequent discovery of Sophie's mutation & her family's attempted flight causes David to wonder at the persecution of human \"Blasphemies\" & the ritual culling of animal & plant \"Deviations\". David & a few others of his generation harbor their own invisible mutation: they have strong telepathic abilities. David begins to question why all who are different must be banished or killed. As they mature, David & his fellow telepaths realize that their unusual mutation would be considered a \"blasphemy\" and they conceal their abilities. That their mutation cannot be directly detected allows their abilities to remain undiscovered for a time. Eventually the group is exposed. David, his half-cousin Rosalind & younger sister Petra flee to the Fringes. Thru the unusually strong telepathic abilities of Petra they make contact with a more advanced society in distant \"Sealand\". David, Rosalind & Petra elude their would-be captors & are rescued by the Sealand mission to discover the source of Petra's telepathic transmissions.\nTho the nature of \"Tribulation\" is not explicitly stated, it is implied that it was a nuclear holocaust, both by the mutations, & by the stories of sailors who report blackened, glassy wastes to the southwest where the remains of faintly glowing cities are seen. Sailors venturing too close to these ruins experience symptoms similar to radiation sickness. A woman from Sealand, a character with evident knowledge of the Old People's technology, mentions \"the power of gods in the hands of children,\"", "title": "Rebirth", "meta": {"work_id": "910927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chrysalids"}}

{"id": "1775449", "text": "The Barnes & Noble Review\nIn his most suspenseful and riveting novel yet, Dean Koontz explores the effects of quantum physics on human relationships in From the Corner of His Eye. If the idea of this complex scientific bent scares you, think again. Although the underlying science and its potential implications are mind-boggling, Koontz flavors it with enough humanity to assure it goes down easily. And the end result will profoundly change the way most readers view their lives, one another, and the world in general.\nBartholomew \"Barty\" Lampion is born on a day marked by tragedy. Both of his parents will die, though thanks to some quick medical help, his mother, Agnes, will return to the living. Little Barty proves himself to be an amazing child almost from the first day -- a prodigy who, by the age of three, is reading at an eighth-grade level. Then tragedy strikes again when a rare type of cancer forces the removal of both of Barty's eyes, leaving him totally blind. Yet despite this setback, Barty continues to amaze everyone with his boundless love of life, his steely determination, and more than a few astonishing perceptions.\nAngel White is born on the same day as Barty, and the circumstances are just as tragic. Not only was Angel conceived during a violent rape, Angel's mother, Seraphim, a 15-year-old African American and the daughter of a Baptist minister, dies during the birth. But something amazing happens first, something that will affect the lives of both the doctor delivering the child and Seraphim's older sister, Celestina, who raises Angel. This child, too, proves to be exceptional.\nIt will be three years before these two remarkable children meet, though their lives are mysteriously intertwined from the moment of their births. Each possesses a unique and rare ability that changes the way they, and those around them, see the world. But a vicious killer wants them both dead, and their eventual confrontation will have a mind-shattering outcome, the effect of which will eventually be felt throughout the universe.\nKoontz deftly blends science with religion in this largely character-driven tale, imbuing the work with a number of spiritual and biblical overtones. In the hands of a writer less skilled, this could be a recipe for disaster. But in the highly capable hands of Koontz, it becomes a compelling tale of human nature and the ripple effect our actions and decisions have on the world around us.\n--Beth Amos\nBeth Amos is the author of three novels, includingCold White Fury andSecond Sight.", "title": "From the Corner of His Eye", "meta": {"work_id": "1775449", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_Corner_of_His_Eye"}}

Ray Bradbury's THE ILLUSTRATEDMAN is a kaleidoscopic blending of magic, imagination, and truth, widely believed to be one of the Grandmaster's premier accomplishments: as exhilarating as interplanetary travel, as maddening as a walk in a million-year rain, and as comforting as simple, familiar rituals on the last night of the world.", "title": "L'homme illustr\u00e9", "meta": {"work_id": "1065861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Illustrated_Man"}}

Satirical and disturbing, Brave New World is set some 600 years ahead, in \"this year of stability, A.F. 632\"--the A.F. standing for After Ford, meaning the godlike Henry Ford. \"Community, Identity, Stability,\" is the motto. Reproduction is controlled through genetic engineering, and people are bred into a rigid class system. As they mature, they are conditioned to be happy with the roles that society has created for them. The rest of their lives are devoted to the pursuit of pleasure through sex, recreational sports, the getting and having of material possessions, and taking a drug called Soma. Concepts such as family, freedom, love, and culture are considered grotesque.\nAgainst this backdrop, a young man known as John the Savage is brought to London from the remote desert of New Mexico. What he sees in the new civilization a \"brave new world\" (quoting Shakespeare's The Tempest). However, ultimately, John challenges the basic premise of this society in an act that threatens and fascinates its citizens.\nHuxley uses his entire prowess to throw the idea of utopia into reverse, presenting us what is known as the \"dystopian\" novel. When Brave New World was written (1931), neither Hitler nor Stalin had risen to power. Huxley saw the enduring threat to society from the dark side of scientific and social progress, and mankind's increasing appetite for simple amusement. Brave New World is a work that indicts the idea of progress for progress sake and is backed up with force and reason.", "title": "Brave New World", "meta": {"work_id": "3204877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World"}}

Shade, the lost baby bat of the first book, has rejoined his colony only to lose his freedom as the bats plunge into a mysterious human building they believe is paradise. The building's vast interior forest, with its teeming insects and eerie absence of owls, certainly seems like Eden. But Shade and his Brightwing friend Marina, now young adults, discover that the humans have a sinister motive for befriending the bats--they are using them as unwitting suicide bombers over a jungle war zone. In addition, the bats are threatened once again by Goth, the giant jungle bat with the cannibalistic tastes and irrepressible knack for survival of Hannibal Lecter. This time he has a plan for making his god, Zotz, supreme: to be explicit (and Oppel is), by ripping out the hearts of 100 imprisoned bats, owls, and rats. Shade's and Marina's race to save their companions from this two-pronged threat makes for exciting and occasionally terrifying reading. \nOnce again Oppel immerses readers in the world view of his tiny flying mammals. It becomes second nature to see things upside down, hide in crevices, squint at the brightness of the sun, and sense danger through sound vibrations. Particularly chilling is his portrayal of the humans' laboratory, with its concentration-camp-like indifference to life. In Sunwing, Oppel offers breathless suspense while eliciting our compassion for these misunderstood creatures of the night.
