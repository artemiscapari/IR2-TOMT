Old buildings with very similar architecture to what they have now.  \n\n\nThey see the same trees there but the trees are in the state that theirs were before they started polluting their planet.  \n\n\nTurns out they may have lived this sequence over and over again and just never keep enough of their history to learn not to pollute their planet.  \n\n\nThat the trees have a defensive mechanism to destroy whatever is killing them.  \n\n\nIf anyone recognises the story and knows the book, please let me know."}

I think they might've been of Islander or Indigenous descent. The death sentence was depicted as part of tradition, and other people sentenced of crimes had died the same way. I don't remember exactly but I think she might've killed someone else.\n\nHer sentence is to stand in mud (or something kind of like quicksand) and slowly sink into it until it envelops her entire body and kills her. The process takes hours.\n\nHer family surround her as she sinks. It's not particularly joyous or grievous, but just a kind of family gathering. They eat food and they talk.\n\nEdit: and reminiscence about good, older memories. I remember the woman's mother was there and a somewhat prominent character. Her family there with her included extended, I think. It was a large family.\n\nAs the woman sinks deeper, she becomes more panicked at her impending death, crying and screaming to her family.\n\nI think the story just ends solemnly with her death."}

{"id": "fznrgq", "title": "[TOMT][book][2015?] a YA Novel that has a cover of a girl in a dress that is made from stars", "description": "I read a book when I was in middle school, 7th or 8th grade so about 4 or 5 years ago. I never got to finish the book\n\nThe book is about a girl who moved to a new town i think? But I do know she moved from the country side and that it was after spring break when her family moved, I remember this because this guy said to the girl it was so unusual for her to change schools so late in the school year.\n\nThe boy started asking about her family (this was the first chapter, he was showing her around the school). The girl said that her mom or dad got a new job and they had to move and that her twin sister recently died, she did die some time ago before the start of the book.

She feels guilty because her little sister is still with her step dad and she can't help her. At one point I think the girl gets a cat. She hangs out with other homeless teens. She's maybe like 14/15. She also almost prostitutes herself off  for money because she's low on cash. Also she hangs out with a boy who ran away or got kicked out because he's gay. One day the girl falls in love with painting murals one day and she does it with her friends to make money. I think the story ended by the mother getting a divorce and the homeless girl comes back.

She feels guilty because her little sister is still with her step dad and she can't help her. At one point I think the girl gets a cat. She hangs out with other homeless teens. She's maybe like 14/15. She also almost prostitutes herself off  for money because she's low on cash. Also she hangs out with a boy who ran away or got kicked out because he's gay. One day the girl falls in love with painting murals one day and she does it with her friends to make money. I think the story ended by the mother getting a divorce and the homeless girl comes back. Also I believe the author is male and relatively popular.

His mother had lion feet, and his dad had gills, so he has scales on his back and clawed toes. \n\nThere's a man named Atticus I think, who had crab hands and couldn't read the books he loved because he would slice the pages. Atticus used to be in love with an intersex person whom the MC calls Corner, which is Coroner but misheard, bc s/he could kill people with a touch, and can also phase through solid surfaces. Corner turned the pages of Atticus' books for him, until s/he left the underground community after they had a huge fight.\n\nMC is in love with a girl with schizophrenia, who keeps going down the \"cold pipes\" against the warnings of the elder community members, forbidden because there are demons there. Girlfriend thinks that the demons are just fake like other things she sees and doesn't see the harm in leading them back to the community. The demons route out the community and force the mutants out into the city above them. MC has to care for his mentally ill girl and other handicapped members. They find safety in the home of a doctor, whom a member knew from before they went hidden. \n\nGirlfriend runs into the city, making MC search for her. He spends a little time at an apartment where they let him sleep as long as he brings in food or contributes.\n\nThe story eventually goes to a mental/medical institution that's abandoned and in wreckage. It's where Atticus and Corner met and fell in love and where several mutants are from. Girlfriend says the demons told her to go there, and MC understands that the place has terrible vibes without understanding quite what it was for.

It had a MC teen boy who lived underground, possibly in the sewers, with a hidden society of other people with mutations. His mother had lion feet, and his dad had gills, so he has scales on his back and clawed toes. \n\nThere's a man named Atticus I think, who had crab hands and couldn't read the books he loved because he would slice the pages. Atticus used to be in love with an intersex person whom the MC calls Corner, which is Coroner but misheard, bc s/he could kill people with a touch, and can also phase through solid surfaces. Corner turned the pages of Atticus' books for him, until s/he left the underground community after they had a huge fight.\n\nMC is in love with a girl with schizophrenia, who keeps going down the \"cold pipes\" against the warnings of the elder community members, forbidden because there are demons there. Girlfriend thinks that the demons are just fake like other things she sees and doesn't see the harm in leading them back to the community. The demons route out the community and force the mutants out into the city above them. MC has to care for his mentally ill girl and other handicapped members. They find safety in the home of a doctor, whom a member knew from before they went hidden. \n\nGirlfriend runs into the city, making MC search for her. He spends a little time at an apartment where they let him sleep as long as he brings in food or contributes.\n\nThe story eventually goes to a mental/medical institution that's abandoned and in wreckage. It's where Atticus and Corner met and fell in love and where several mutants are from. Girlfriend says the demons told her to go there, and MC understands that the place has terrible vibes without understanding quite what it was for. Girl also wears a ton of hospital bracelets, evidence of some institutionalization.\n\nAt the end, MC is told by an elder that his girl needs help, and he can do her the most good by getting her that help. He resolves to do just that."}

The story was a mystery, I think there may have been a small amount of magical realism near the end but from what I remember it was a pretty standard mystery where the main character was possibly trying to solve a murder or disappearance or some other strange happening. \n\nWhat made the book really unique was that it came in a small box that included the text but also lots of little pieces of paper that were photos, short messages, business cards, etc. The characters in the story would come across small pieces of evidence and these were the extra pieces that were included with the physical copy of the book. I remember distinctly that one of the papers had a phone number on it that you could call in real life and listen to a pre-recorded message. I think at least a few of the papers looked like they had handwriting on them, as if they had been written by a real person. Also included in these extra pieces was at least one photograph, and I think the people in one of the photos had had their eyes scratched out. One of the extra pieces also had braille on it that you were meant to decode.\n\nAll of these extra pieces were so that you could sort of solve the mystery yourself along with the characters in the story. It was very immersive and I have not come across a book like it since. \n\nI also seem to remember that the cover of the book looked like a package wrapped in craft paper and tied with twine, or possibly featured a manilla folder tied with twine?

The book was mostly about all the rehab exercises they did with the kid, and theyad to install a play gym setup in their house.  Googling anything Jeremiah-related only brings up bible verses.

One child (a girl) barely escapes. She might\u2019ve had another sibling who was also killed. It\u2019s winter in like Colorado area so there\u2019s a big risk of death by exposure for the little girl.

{"id": "efrfrm", "title": "[TOMT][BOOK][2000's or older] A story about a cat learning how to use supernatural \"cat\" powers from an older cat, with the final power being invisibility", "description": "Hi there, so this was a story that I read as a kid or early teenager, likely one from my school's library, so obviously any hardcore adult stories are off the table. However, I do recall that part of the plot involved a cat, who I think was described as a grey-blue color, having to fight off a group of other cats, so violence was described. At some point, the main cat discovered an older (possibly male) cat who could use various \"supernatural\" abilities. The way they described them was more \"inherent abilities that needed to be unlocked\" rather than straight-up magic. \n\nPart of the book revolved around the main cat visiting the older cat to teach them how to use the various powers, with each power being its own level.

The party includes, parents, adult son, pregnant adult daughter, female guest, black male servant. Someone knocks on the door and they think its the daughter boyfriend but its a really dirty hobo looking dude who leaves. A bomb or nuke warning of some sort is heard and they all head to the houses bomb shelter. Something happens and when they all wake up and leave the shelter the landscape is completely different. Basically, they  traveled forward it time but they don't know that yet.\n\nThey live for a while like that, the father has an affair with the female guest, she becomes pregnant with twin boys. I think after the mother leaves to live elsewhere with the son. Daughter dies in childbirth after having a sickly baby girl. I think the baby dies too.\n\nEventually the owner of the land shows up. Black people now rule the entire world and the darker your skin the higher your rank usually is. Inheritance is through the female line but men are the rulers. The owner is interested in the white people from the past and takes them to live on his estate. He's mostly interested in games and the history of their time period because most of the information was lost. White are slaves and cattle in this future. The mother becomes a literal bed warmer for owner. She enjoys this since its a place of high status and she gets to eat all day. The son has his thumbs cut off and is castrated because that's what happens to male servants. Mother is perfectly fine with this. At some point they learn that the meat in their food is people.\n\nFemale guest has her babies while being held captive at the estate and owner wants them to be a perfect matching pair of servants for him. Father and female guest don't want this for their babies so they plot to escape. At some point the father sends a message to female guest that includes the line \"gemini wasn't meant to sing soprano\" (or something very similar) in an attempt to send a coded message using the slang of their time period.

The final scene is after they disembark.\n\nI believe the boy is made fun of because they shop at some sort of large-scale discount store. \n\nAt one point, they see a movie in the theater about cats and dogs that are spies. \n\nSomeone at school calls the protagonist\u2019s sister the b-word, and this upsets him and he wonders if they mean she\u2019s like the dog from the movie.\n\nThat\u2019s a random tidbit to remember, but I was afraid of getting in trouble because the book had a swear. \n\nI know this isn\u2019t much to go on, but I\u2019ve never been able to track this book down.\n\nI think it had a sequel advertised in the back cover, but I never read it!"}

Anyway, she would get teased by the other birds and at some point her friend convinced her to sing in the talent show. And she ends up winning and becomes the Texas state bird.
