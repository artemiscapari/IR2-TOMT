Might not have even been woods, maybe it was the guy's property, just some place fairly secluded, maybe a wooded park. There _may_ have been another kid we parted from in the course of our investigation.\n\nAt the moment, I really can't remember anything other than that. Except that _maybe_ we were investigating the car for a shovel or rake or something. Hopefully \"kid's book with endings where you're trapped in a strange man's trunk\" will help this stick out to anyone versed in choose-your-own-adventure books published earlier than 2001.\n\nEdit: I actually didn't realize until now that \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" was a line of books under a single company. I don't know how likely it is that this book was a part of that line or not. Looking through them, the closest one seems to be _Scene of the Crime_, but I haven't seen anything to confirm that \"trapped in the trunk of a car\" is one of the endings. These don't seem to be uploaded to Google Books, and I probably wouldn't be able to find the right page before running out of free pages anyway."}

Since he's not yet independent and still living off his parents, when the main character's (I think a boy around 13-15 years old?) current avatar dies, he decides he'll try a new joke, charisma-based character to just trash later; but in one interaction with an NPC shop keeper, he is gifted a finely cut gem, making more in that one interaction than most people would in probably a couple weeks or so. At this point, he and his friends start to realize there may be other ways to play this game.\n\nThere are a few very distinct scenes/story points that I remember:\n\n1) The main character and 3 of his friends (best friend, love interest, and some other person) with extremely cheep bows and arrows, and attempt to fight a dragon, abusing the game's aggression mechanic so that it walks towards one person who just attacked it, then gets hit by someone farther away, forcing it to switch targets before it's close enough to attack the first person, with people on either side holding attacks in case someone misses their shot, so they could quickly draw aggression. It takes them a very long time (possibly even multiple days), but they killed it and made a *huge* amount of money by the books standards.\n\n2) Legal issues in this world were settled in something like 3v3 duels to the death with the ruling council of this VR world and the outside country/continent, in a special arena where death was not permanent. These rulers were outfitted with exceptionally powerful gear, meaning the laws were never really challenged.\n\n3) (and possible spoilers) Towards the end of the book, the kids basically cause some sort of revolution, and a huge war breaks out.

{"id": "cnfdq0", "title": "[TOMT][GRAPHIC NOVEL]", "description": "Hello!\n\nWhile browsing a bookstore just over a week ago I was looking at a graphic novel they had on the shelf. It was pretty large (\\~30cm x 23cm or \\~12\" x 9\") and was hardcover. Mostly what I remember is just how beautiful and colourful it was. The cover had a gorgeous abstract design on a white background. The design was made up of many different large, distorted raindrop/fluid shapes all mushed together. It took up maybe 1/3-1/2 of the cover and they were brightly coloured. There were at least two young characters on the cover who looked like they were falling from the top. One of them was on the left and one was on the right of the colourful design. The girl on the left looked kind of like if the character Connie from Steven Universe was mixed with the character Mabel from Gravity Falls. On that note, the art style for the characters reminded me of Steven Universe, Gravity Falls, We Bare Bears, and a little bit of Bryan Lee O'Malley. Just that cute kinda chibi-esque look. Given that art style I would be confident in guessing it was written after 2010 but that could be wrong. Flipping through the pages I remember the art inside was beautiful and bright as well, all in colour. \n\nAs for the story I don't really know anything about it. I was just flipping through the pages admiring the artwork. I wanted to buy it but had to leave as I was running late and couldn't decide if I wanted to spend the money in time. It was $25-26 (Canadian). I do remember one panel really distinctly. It was a child (could have been a young boy or girl) with short hair. They were surrounded by bubbles. The background of this panel was black but the child and the bubbles were lit up with either orange/yellow or blue/green light. \n\nI thought I would remember the title but I realized today I have forgotten it. I thought it was called 'Slip' but once I googled that nothing resembling the graphic novel came up. I do think the title was one word and I think that word had an 'S' at the beginning or a prominent 'S' sound in it. I'm not completely sure about that though. \n\nI've tried looking through some internet lists of graphic novels with beautiful art but I have not seen it. I could return to the bookstore but it was a couple hours away from my home and it may not be there anymore.

The girl doesn't really understand or get along with her grandmother, who seems to stay in her room at lot.\n\nOn the girl's birthday, her grandmother doesn't come down to the party. Weirdly I remember that the girl was given a pan of brownies as a present (which I thought was odd) by a friend.\n\nThat night, the girl sneaks down to the kitchen and cuts \"a strip of brownies\" and then \"carefully washed and dried the plate.\" Yes, I literally remember those lines. \n\nAs she's about to sneak back up to her room, she sees her grandmother's glasses sitting on the stairs with the moonlight shining through them. She picks them up and, for fun, puts them on.\n\nWhen she puts on the glasses, she can suddenly she her grandmother and (late) grandfather as young people courting in the 1900s. Her grandmother, the girl notices, has heart-shaped buttons on her dress. She watches for a moment and begins to understand her grandmother better. She takes the glasses off and returns them.\n\nThe next day, she speaks to her grandmother about her grandfather courting her and mentions the heart-shaped buttons. The grandmother is surprised but pleased and says that, for some reason, that memory seems stronger now, like someone went back and looked at it again. And, thereafter, they get along better. The end.\n\nI remember the illustrations were slightly soppy, sentimental pastels, but I loved it.\n\nWhat's killing me is that I found the title and author of this book a few years ago through some really serious Googling and I remember the publisher was something like \"Goblin Press\" or \"Hobgoblin Press.\" I even found a review of the book that said adults might like it more than children because it was so sentimental!

Her grandmother, the girl notices, has heart-shaped buttons on her dress. She watches for a moment and begins to understand her grandmother better. She takes the glasses off and returns them.\n\nThe next day, she speaks to her grandmother about her grandfather courting her and mentions the heart-shaped buttons. The grandmother is surprised but pleased and says that, for some reason, that memory seems stronger now, like someone went back and looked at it again. And, thereafter, they get along better. The end.\n\nI remember the illustrations were slightly soppy, sentimental pastels, but I loved it.\n\nWhat's killing me is that I found the title and author of this book a few years ago through some really serious Googling and I remember the publisher was something like \"Goblin Press\" or \"Hobgoblin Press.\" I even found a review of the book that said adults might like it more than children because it was so sentimental!

{"id": "gkeclf", "title": "[TOMT][Book][2000s?] Young adult book about two girls who run away from home disguised as boys, possibly set during the Great Depression.", "description": "Hello everybody,\n\nI'm trying to find a book I read when I was younger. I believe I read it when I was either a young teenager or a preteen, so this would have been in the mid to late 2000s, but the book may have been around for longer than that. I remember quite a lot about the plot of this book, I think I would even recognize the cover, but I just cannot find the title.\n\nThe story takes place in the USA, I'm pretty sure during the Great Depression. The story is about a preteen or young teenage girl who's father remarried - the main character does not really get along with her stepmother, so her family arranges for the main character to permanently live with her grandmother while the rest of the family moves away. However, the main character changes her mind and wants to be with her family, so she runs away from her grandmother's home. Another girl the same age as the main character also comes along on this journey, I don't quite remember why, she may have been the main character's cousin or something. The two girls decide to disguise themselves as boys in order to travel across the county and find the main character's family (I don't remember exactly how far they traveled, but I think they had to cross state lines at least). Unfortunately, the grandmother does not want the girls to leave, so she sends a goon to follow the girls and bring them back. This goon was a man who I don't think was very intelligent and who was scared of the main character's grandmother - I seem to remember there being some kind of superstitious angle where the grandmother said she would put a curse on this man if he didn't do what she said and he was scared and believed her. I believe this book was also either a young adult Christian novel, or at least intended to be a family friendly book, so the grandmother is portrayed as a bad character who mixes superstition with Christianity, or something like that.\n\nI remember several things that happen to the girls during their journey; at one point they are invited to spend the night at a friendly family's home, but they are scared to take their hats off because this would give away the fact that they have long hair and are not really boys. I also remember one part where another character offers them a ride in his car on a windy road through some large hills/mountains, and so he honks his horn before attempting any sharp turns, because back when this story takes place the roads were narrow and only one car could pass at once. Also, at some point the girls meet a boy their age who owns a pocket dictionary and who tries to learn one new word from it every day. Because of this, he uses strange words like \"troglodyte\" several times in the story. The boy eventually gives the main character his dictionary, if I'm not mistaken. During the entire journey, the girls are running away from their grandmother's goon, who almost catches them, but they eventually find the main character's family and there is a happy ending, if I am remembering correctly.\n\nI might not be recalling everything exactly right, but I feel pretty strongly about all the details I just mentioned. I think I can even describe the cover to some extent, it had a picture of the two girls, dressed as boys, running through a train rail yard, and the grandmother's goon is emerging from behind a train car behind them. I'm surprised I haven't been able to locate this book, but I'm guessing the young adult, possibly Christian book market is pretty saturated and this book might not be that well known.\n\nThanks to everyone who reads this and helps out - I really appreciate it!", "meta": {"author": "itslocked94", "replies": [{"id": "fqqua88", "body": "[Click here for a link to the answer!](/r/tipofmytongue/comments/gkeclf/tomtbook2000s_young_adult_book_about_two_girls/fqqrjyf/)", "created_date": "2020-05-15T19:47:55+00:00", "author_name": "TipOfMyCircuitBoard", "replies": null}, {"id": "fqqj9gb", "body": "If this book sounds familiar to anyone, but you can't remember the title, feel free to add any plot points you may recall - that might jog my memory at some point.", "created_date": "2020-05-15T18:14:46+00:00", "author_name": "itslocked94", "replies": null}, {"id": "fqqrjyf", "body": "[The Overland Escape](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/840212.The_Overland_Escape) by Lee Roddy?", "created_date": "2020-05-15T19:24:36+00:00", "author_name": "ialmostguaranteeit", "replies": [{"id": "fqqu9o6", "body": "Solved!", "created_date": "2020-05-15T19:47:48+00:00", "author_name": "itslocked94", "replies": null}, {"id": "fqqua5k", "body": "Congratulations, you have been given 1 point for solving this post!", "created_date": "2020-05-15T19:47:54+00:00", "author_name": "TipOfMyCircuitBoard", "replies": null}, {"id": "fqqudxg", "body": "You nailed it!

{"id": "cbvzur", "title": "[TOMT] [BOOK] [2000s] YA Novel about a teenage girl who gets pregnant and has a baby in high school (goes into labor at prom), but the father is kept a secret til the end, and it turns out he died earlier in the year?", "description": "I don't know if it's possible to find this book, I've been searching with whatever keywords I can think of and can't find it, but I can't get it out of my mind since another post sparked my memory about it. I must've read it when I was in grade school or early high school, so 10-15 years ago, but I don't know when it came out. Definitely not before the 90s, though. I'd guess early 2000s.\n\nThe plot, as far as I remember, is that a girl (and this was all told in first person) is pregnant in high school. Pretty sure the book starts with her pregnant. We don't see how she got pregnant, but there might be flashbacks or hints at backstory. We don't know who the father is, but she has a best friend, who's a guy, and everyone assumes he's the father but he's not. She's \"white,\" and he's black, and this is important later.\n\nI don't remember a lot of the middle, but I remember she goes into labor at a dance, maybe prom. The only reason I remember this is because I remember a scene where she's getting dressed for the dance (and she's pretty pregnant) and she goes to put on high heels, and she gets a pain in her back when she puts them on, which is her beginning to go into labor, but she thinks it's from the heels, so she puts on flats instead and goes to the dance.\n\nAnyway, she ends up having the baby, and it turns out the baby is mixed race. And she's pretty surprised, because (and I think this is where we learn who the father was) the dad was white, and she's white. But then her mom tells her that *her* father was black, so *she's* actually biracial and never knew it. And I remember the *mother* of her best friend visiting her after she gave birth and asking if *he* (the best friend) was the father (because he's black), and the protagonist said no, I'm black, not the father, and then the mother was like, ohhh I see it now.\n\nAnd I think the actual father of the baby died in a car wreck before he even knew she was pregnant?

I must've read it when I was in grade school or early high school, so 10-15 years ago, but I don't know when it came out. Definitely not before the 90s, though. I'd guess early 2000s.\n\nThe plot, as far as I remember, is that a girl (and this was all told in first person) is pregnant in high school. Pretty sure the book starts with her pregnant. We don't see how she got pregnant, but there might be flashbacks or hints at backstory. We don't know who the father is, but she has a best friend, who's a guy, and everyone assumes he's the father but he's not. She's \"white,\" and he's black, and this is important later.\n\nI don't remember a lot of the middle, but I remember she goes into labor at a dance, maybe prom. The only reason I remember this is because I remember a scene where she's getting dressed for the dance (and she's pretty pregnant) and she goes to put on high heels, and she gets a pain in her back when she puts them on, which is her beginning to go into labor, but she thinks it's from the heels, so she puts on flats instead and goes to the dance.\n\nAnyway, she ends up having the baby, and it turns out the baby is mixed race. And she's pretty surprised, because (and I think this is where we learn who the father was) the dad was white, and she's white. But then her mom tells her that *her* father was black, so *she's* actually biracial and never knew it. And I remember the *mother* of her best friend visiting her after she gave birth and asking if *he* (the best friend) was the father (because he's black), and the protagonist said no, I'm black, not the father, and then the mother was like, ohhh I see it now.\n\nAnd I think the actual father of the baby died in a car wreck before he even knew she was pregnant? I think she maybe was new to the school and he was super popular and then she realized she was pregnant right after he died and she didn't want to tarnish his reputation postmortem and was willing to wear the label of \"slut\" to protect his memory?\n\nI don't even know why I'm so obsessed with figuring this out, I have no desire to read the book again, it's just one of those things where it's going to bug the living shit out of me if I can't find it.\n\nIf anyone knows what I'm talking about (and I don't think it was, like, that popular of a book or anything, so good luck) I will be eternally grateful!!!"}

The main character was a minor noble (or heir to nobility?) who I think had PTSD from fighting on the front lines, and may have had another mental health problem I can't recall (or maybe he was just drowning in ennui). He seemed distant and emotionless all the time, even when he was consummating his arranged marriage. (I'm pretty sure he wasn't attracted to women anyway, but the setting didn't seem to acknowledge non-hetero sexualities.)\n\nAlso there was a bit where someone had used the equivalent of a computer (which used crystals and tubes?) to calculate the result of a thought experiment that turned out to be our universe, and our solar system specifically.\n\nI can't for the life of me remember how it ended, or if it even had a proper conclusion at all. I don't remember if I even finished reading it all the way through. In retrospect I probably missed a lot of the point, and I want to see if it makes any more sense with a more careful reading."}

{"id": "fsw8ph", "title": "[TOMT][BOOK][mid-1900s]About a miner named Mole, drunk, abusive toward his wife, has young son", "description": "I remember getting about halfway through a pretty interesting book where the woman is the main character. She marries a disgusting drunkard of a man whose only sort-of saving grace is that he at the very least somewhat provides for his family. Her young son is ambitious and smart and begins to work at a young age (12 or so?) in an office. He has to take the train or bus on his own to work and stays there all day. He is his mother's pride and joy--handsome, healthy, and helpful, contributing to the money that the father is very stingy with and often spends on alcohol. The father, a nasty man who is always angry (I believe I remember multiple violent incidents?) and comes home mainly to eat and sleep and terrorize everyone, is referred to as Mole--possibly a nickname the wife comes up for him?

Like he wore a pair of overalls and the little heart was sticking out or it was in his lunch box. It\u2019s one of those books that my mother had and read to me as a kid. My mother and I don\u2019t have a good relationship now but when I was very young she was a better mom and honestly I\u2019d like to buy this book and have it for nostalgia sake or read it to my future children but my mother and I are no contact and so I can\u2019t ask her for the book or even the name of it but honestly I would be so grateful is someone remembers this book or could give me the name.

He and his Mom move and the kids in his new school don\u2019t play or understand the game so he gets bullied.  There is a large mansion in town and at the end the kids have a party there where the boy gets everyone to dress like characters from his game and do a sort of LARP version of the game but there\u2019s a killer in the mansion stalking them and murdering some of them.

It was somewhat of a popular series when it first came out, not super big but not super small (it did have three books (or four?) so it was popular enough.) I read the first book in 2014, but it could have come out a little earlier.

But if Jack hadn't broken the high school rushing record that night, he never would have known and nothing would have changed. He'd just be going out for pizza, playing football, trying yet again to score with his girlfriend, P.J. But he did break the record. He appeared on the news. And now they've found him. Jack plunges into a space-time-bending game of survival with no way out. The rules are shrouded in secrets. But one thing he learns fast: Trust no one. After centuries of abuse, the earth is dying, and it's up to Jack to reverse the decline before the Turning Point, when nothing will ever be the same again. Beaten into shape by a ninja babe and a huge telepathic man's best friend, Jack hurtles across the ocean to save the future from the present and to solve the mystery of his purpose.", "created_date": "2019-09-22T05:48:15+00:00", "author_name": "ceefrock", "replies": [{"id": "f131h51", "body": "Oh my gosh yes!!
