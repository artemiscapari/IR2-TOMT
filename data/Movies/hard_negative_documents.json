Frank invites her into his store, where she is taken with his work restoring antique department store mannequins.

{"id": "tt0057093", "text": "The story is set in 1895 France and takes place predominantly in Paris. However, it begins on a farm in rural Provence. The lovely cat Mewsette and the accomplished but shy mouser Jaune Tom are in love, until the former is frustrated with his plebeian ways (and those of the farm), to the point of calling him a \"clumsy country clod\". Inspired by the human Jeanette's stories of glamour and sophistication in Paris, Mewsette runs away by taking a train to the big city, where she encounters the slick con-cat Meowrice. Taking advantage of the country kitty's naivete, he puts her in the care of the sultry Madame Henretta Reubens-Chatte, who promises to turn Mewsette into a dainty debutante known as \"The Belle of all Paris\". Unbeknownst to Mewsette, Meowrice is grooming her to be the mail-order bride of a rich American cat in Pittsburgh known as \"Mr. Henry Phtt\". Meanwhile, Jaune Tom and his sidekick Robespierre arrive in Paris, searching for Mewsette.\nTraining does not go well. Just as Mewsette is about to give up and return to the farm, Meowrice takes her out to see the cat side of Paris, the Eiffel Tower, the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es and the Mewlon Rouge and then take a buggy ride back home. Reinvigorated, she returns to her studies. Jaune Tom and Robespierre arrive just at that moment but get waylaid by one of Meowrice's shadowy cat henchmen and barely escape drowning in Paris's famous labyrinthine sewers. By coincidence, Jaune Tom displays his incredible mouse-hunting skills in front of Meowrice (known as \"Virtue-Mousety\"), who sees a money-making opportunity, gets them drunk, and sells them as mousers to a ship bound for Alaska. On the ship, Robespierre consoles a depressed Jaune Tom, telling him that any problem, regardless of size, can be broken up into manageable pieces, by remarking that even the mighty ocean is made up of little drops of water. Jaune Tom has a vision of Mewsette singing about how no problem is unconquerable, and the importance of never giving up.\nMewsette finishes her training and is now lovely enough to impress even Meowrice, who commissions a series of paintings of her by such famous artists as Claude Monet, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Georges Seurat, Henri Rousseau, Amedeo Modigliani, Vincent van Gogh, Edgar Degas, Auguste Renoir, Paul C\u00e9zanne, Paul Gauguin and Pablo Picasso (an opportunity for the animators to indulge in some artistic parodies), so that he can send them to Mr. Phtt. Meowrice quietly writes a check to pay his \"sister\", Madame Reubens-Chatte (using disappearing ink, so that the check is worthless), and takes Mewsette to his hideout in Notre Dame. There, he reveals his plan to ship her to America and tries to coerce her to enter a luggage crate, but after seeing a portrait of Mr. Phtt depicting him as fat and old, she manages to escape Meowrice and his sidekicks. In the resulting chase scene, she leads them to a bulldog, who injures Meowrice badly enough to put him out of action for six weeks. Meanwhile, his sycophants (who are nowhere near as intelligent as he is) comb the city without success, searching for Mewsette.\nMeanwhile, not long after they reach Alaska (a howling wilderness of snow), Jaune Tom and Robespierre strike gold thanks to the former's mouse-hunting skills. Now wealthy, the two cats hurry back to Paris.\nA disillusioned and homeless Mewsette wanders around the streets of Paris and stops atop a bridge over the river where she attempts to leap to her death, but she is captured by Meowrice and his sidekicks. She is taken to the Gare du Nord railway station, en route to a boat to America, and all hope seems lost, when Jaune Tom and Robespierre arrive. They have been aided by Madame Ruebens-Chatte, who is irritated that her own \"brother\" double-crossed her and tears up the worthless check. In a humorously over-the-top fight scene inside the boxcar of a moving train, the three heroes defeat Meowrice and pack him into the crate intended for Mewsette, doubtless that this will be a nasty surprise for Mr. Phtt.

Before falling asleep, Geppetto wishes on a star for Pinocchio to be a real boy. During the night, a Blue Fairy visits the workshop and brings Pinocchio to life, although he remains a puppet. She informs him that if he proves himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, he will become a real boy and assigns Jiminy to be his conscience. Geppetto is shocked but ecstatic to discover his puppet is alive. \nThe next day, on his way to school, Pinocchio is led astray by con-artist fox Honest John, who convinces him to join Stromboli's puppet show and become a star as a \"live puppet without strings,\" despite Jiminy's objections. Pinocchio becomes Stromboli's star attraction as a marionette who can sing and dance without strings. However, when Pinocchio wants to go home for the night, Stromboli locks him in a cage, intending to exploit Pinocchio by forcing him to perform worldwide to make much money just for the puppeteer himself and then to use the little wooden boy as firewood once he gets too old to perform. After Jiminy unsuccessfully tries to free his friend, the Blue Fairy appears and asks Pinocchio why he was not at school. Jiminy urges Pinocchio to tell the truth, but instead, he starts telling lies, which causes his nose to grow longer and longer. Pinocchio vows to be good from now on, and the Blue Fairy returns his nose to its original form and sets him free while warning him that this will be the last time she can help him.\nMeanwhile, Honest John is promised money by a coachman if he can find \"stupid little boys\" for him to take to Pleasure Island. Though Honest John and his sidekick Gideon the Cat are terrified at the implication of the Coachman's statement that none of the boys ever come back \"as boys\", they lead astray Pinocchio while on his way home, and Honest John convinces him to take a vacation on Pleasure Island after his terrible experience with Stromboli. On the way to Pleasure Island, Pinocchio befriends Lampwick, a delinquent boy. Without rules or authority to enforce their activity, Pinocchio, Lampwick and the other boys soon engage in smoking cigars and cigarettes, gambling, vandalism, and getting drunk, much to Jiminy's dismay. Later, Jiminy discovers that the island hides a horrible curse: the boys brought to Pleasure Island are turned into donkeys for their misdeeds and are sold by the Coachman to slave labor in salt mines and circuses. Pinocchio witnesses Lampwick transform into a donkey, and with Jiminy's help, he narrowly escapes the island only partially transformed, though they have to abandon Lampwick and the other boys in the clutches of the Coachman.\nUpon returning home, Pinocchio and Jiminy find the workshop vacant. They soon get a letter from the Blue Fairy as a dove, stating that Geppetto had gone out looking for Pinocchio but was swallowed by Monstro, a terrible sperm whale, and is now living in the belly of the beast. Determined to rescue his father, Pinocchio jumps into the sea, accompanied by Jiminy. Pinocchio is soon swallowed by Monstro as well, where he finds Geppetto. Pinocchio devises a scheme to make Monstro sneeze, giving them a chance to escape. The scheme works, but the enraged whale chases them and smashes their raft. Pinocchio pulls Geppetto to safety in a cave before Monstro crashes into it. Geppetto, Figaro, Cleo, and Jiminy wash up safely on a beach, but Pinocchio is seemingly killed. \nBack home, Geppetto, Jiminy, and the pets are inconsolable over the loss of Pinocchio. However, the Blue Fairy decides that Pinocchio has proven himself brave, truthful, and selfless; to reward him, she reverses the Pleasure Island curse and turns him into a real human boy, reviving him in the process, much to everyone's joy.

One of the serum barrels falls out, rolls away, and leaks behind a bowling arcade, contaminating ice cream.

When they stumble into a bar and are attacked by its patrons, they exhibit abnormal symptoms, such as increased strength and endurance. Nick then tells them about the serum, and he reveals he was also exposed to it. Nick suspects it has infected most of the population and the five of them are immune because all of them were infected while consuming dairy products, which might have neutralized the serum's toxins. Convinced the military will hunt them down to cover up the incident, Nick proposes they stay together to ensure their safety.\nNick unsuccessfully spies on Colonel South and Dr. Richter, the people responsible for the experiment, and later goes off to steal information about the serum.

On the train home, Michael meets a mysterious married woman, Joanna, who proposes a \"hypothetical\" situation: she asks him to locate \"Prynne,\" the alias of an unknown passenger whom Joanna claims has a stolen item. Joanna tells Michael that he will find $25,000 in the bathroom and be paid a further $75,000 when his task is done. Alluding to Michael being a former cop, she departs, and he finds the $25,000.\nMichael attempts to leave the train with the money, but is stopped by a young teenager with an envelope containing his wife's wedding ring, which he tells him is a warning. Unable to reach his wife by phone, he discreetly approaches fellow commuter Walt, writing a note on his newspaper to contact the police. Michael leaves Murphy a voicemail describing the situation, and receives a call from Joanna threatening him and his family.

{"id": "tt0101628", "text": "The film begins where the previous film left off, as Charlie McFadden (Don Keith Opper) still in his role as an alien bounty hunter, is about to destroy two Critter eggs. He is suddenly stopped by a hologram message from his alien friend Ug (Terrance Mann), who tells him the eggs are the last two Critters in existence and that it is against an intergalactic law to cause their extinction. Charlie protests that the Critters are too dangerous to keep alive, but he obeys Ug's orders to place the eggs in a preservation capsule that suddenly falls from the sky. As Charlie puts the eggs in the pod, the hatch closes on him and he is launched into space.\nOver a half-century later, in 2045, the crew of the salvage ship RSS Tesla finds the pod in deep space and bring it aboard. The ship is crewed by the shady and lecherous Captain Rick Buttram (Anders Hove); along with his eccentric engineer Al \"Albert\" Bert (Brad Dourif); pilot Fran (Angela Bassett); cargo specialist Bernie (Eric Da Re); and young engineer apprentice Ethan (Paul Whitthorne), who anxiously anticipates seeing his father back on Earth. While Rick and Bernie bully Ethan, Fran and Albert show him more appreciation.\nAfter examining the pod, Ethan discovers the emblem of the old Intergalactic Council on the side and questions the legality of claiming it for salvage. After reporting their find, the ship gets a communication from Councilor Tetra (Terrance Mann), of TerraCor, who offers Rick three times the going rate if he brings the pod to a nearby station. Fran, Bernie and Albert encourage Rick to accept the deal, but Ethan disputes going off course as it will delay his trip home.\nEventually, the crew decides to go to the station, but find the facility abandoned and barely kept running by a malfunctioning central computer named \"Angela\" that will not obey orders unless given the exact opposite instruction. Matters are more problematic when Albert learns the reactor is leaking radiation although he does not anticipate it becoming critical for a month or so. Rick has bigger plans and secretly decides to rip off the others and take the contents of the pod for himself.\nEventually, Ethan stumbles upon Rick tampering with the pod, and Rick offers to cut him into his scheme saying his plan will get them back to Earth sooner. When Ethan refuses to abandon the others, Rick knocks him unconscious with a fire extinguisher. Rick manages to open the pod and encounters an excited Charlie who quickly jumps out. Infuriated, Rick refuses to believe Charlie is the only thing in the pod and crawls inside for himself. There, he discovers the freshly hatched baby Critters who quickly attack and kill him.\nCharlie tries to shoot the Critters with Rick's gun but the critters manage to run off. He then revives Ethan and goes off to pursue the Critters with the confused boy in tow. Eventually, they meet up with the rest of the crew and Charlie explains who he is and how he came to be in the pod. While the crew contemplates his wild story, Bernie departs refusing to believe that \"man-eating furballs\" are running loose on the station.\nEthan then uses a computer keycard he earlier found outside a research lab to access a report made by Dr. McCormick (Anne Ramsay), who reveals that she was conducting research on various alien organisms for use as a bioweapon. Unfortunately, her creations could not reproduce on their own and she requested finding a suitable organism capable of rapid reproduction. After realizing what has been going on aboard the station, Albert strongly suggests they all leave it immediately.\nMeanwhile, Bernie sneaks into the station's pharmacy to steal drugs. The Critters sneak up on him and he becomes their next meal. After the others find his remains, Angela announces that the reactor will go critical within hours and starts sealing off sections of the station. Albert realizes the reactor was in far worse shape than he originally thought. The crew are then forced to crawl through tight service tunnels to reach their ship, during which they find a clutch of freshly laid Critter eggs and learn the Critters are breeding.\nUnknown to the crew, the Critters have made their way to the Tesla and program the ship to head for the nearest inhabited planet \u2013 Earth. One Critter tells the other to \"get the kids\" while it preps the ship for take-off. Once the crew arrive, Albert hands Charlie the only weapon he has; an antique Colt revolver. Charlie wastes no time using it when they encounter the Critters on the ship, but his shots not only kill the Critters, but destroys the flight controls leaving the ship dead in the water.\nWhile the crew attempt repairs, Ethan takes the gun to hunt down the last Critter himself. He finds the creature in the science lab using the equipment there to rapidly grow several baby Critters to full size. He then runs back to the ship to warn the others just as a Terracor ship carrying Tetra and his troopers arrives.\nThe surviving crew rush to meet Tetra, but finds the troopers pointing their weapons at them. Tetra demands the Critter eggs but Albert refuses to be threatened. Ethan arrives just as Tetra shoots and kills Albert. Tetra then knocks Fran to the deck while Charlie stands confounded that his old alien friend Ug has turned selfishly evil. Ug says \"things change\" and then orders his troops to go find the eggs.\nStill unnoticed, Ethan runs back to the science lab and sets up a trap for Tetra's troopers. When they arrive he seals them inside with the pack of hungry critters. He then retrieves the Critter eggs from the tunnel and brings them back to Tetra while juggling them carelessly in the air. To Tetra's astonishment, Ethan purposely drops and breaks two of the eggs leaving one left. After Tetra threatens to kill Fran, Ethan tosses the last egg to distract him. Fran then notices the revolver hidden in Ethan's waistband and quickly strikes Tetra in the head with it, knocking him out.\nCharlie and Fran then rush aboard Tetra's ship to prepare for take-off, but Ethan lingers to mourn over Albert's body. Suddenly, the last Critter appears and attacks him, but Ethan manages to flash freeze the Critter with a fuel hose. As Ethan recovers he finds Tetra pointing a gun at him. Charlie returns and points the revolver at Tetra who doubts that Charlie even has the guts to pull the trigger. Charlie utters, \"Things change, Ug\", and shoots Tetra in the head.\nAngela then warns that the reactor will go critical in a matter of moments and the survivors rush aboard Tetra's ship to escape.

Along the journey, a Korean warrior (seemingly her fianc\u00e9) attempts to seize her back, but Meng Yi saves her. Meng Yi protects Ok-Soo through their journey back, while Ok-Soo tends to his wounds. In the process, she begins to develop feelings for him but Meng Yi, while apparently harboring similar feelings for her, steps back, reminding her of her purpose of becoming a concubine in the interests of her people and successfully completes his mission. The Qin emperor becomes critically ill later and sends Meng Yi to find the elixir of immortality, the only thing that can save his life. Before leaving, Meng Yi discreetly confesses his feelings to Ok-Soo, stating \"my heart belongs to you forever,\" and Ok-Soo vows to await his return. The guards escorting the elixir are ambushed by rebels on the orders of the treacherous prince and chancellor. Meng Yi hands over the elixir to his deputy, Nangong Yan, before dying in the ensuing battle. Although Nangong Yan manages to bring the elixir to the emperor, the prince and chancellor trick Nangong Yan and Ok-soo to test the validity of the elixir and force them to consume the elixir, condemning them to imprisonment in the Qin emperor's mausoleum for eternity.\nIn the present day, Jack, an archaeologist (also Chan), is Meng Yi's reincarnation, and he often dreams about his past life. One day, his friend William invites him on a quest to find a rare material that can create a field of zero gravity. They travel to a floating tomb of a Dasar prince in India, where Jack discovers a painting of the princess he has been seeing in his dreams. Jack also learns that during a mission to the Qin Empire, the Dasar prince brought treasures and women as gifts. In return, the Qin emperor offered him one of his concubines and asked him to choose, but refused when the prince chose his favourite, Ok-soo. Instead, the Qin emperor gave him a painting of Ok-soo and the Qin Star Gem. William removes a strange black rock from a feline statue, and accidentally collapses the zero gravity field holding up the tomb, resulting in its destruction. William manages to escape, but Jack leaps off a cliff and falls into a river. He loses consciousness and drifts along with the current until he is saved by Samantha, an Indian peasant girl. Samantha brings Jack to see her uncle, a Kalaripayattu (Indian martial art form) guru, who tells Jack to take the sword he found and fight with one of his students. During the fight, Jack has a recollection of a duel he had with the Dasar prince in his past life, and briefly recovers his fighting skills from his life as Meng Yi. Samantha's uncle enlightens Jack about his past and future, and Jack succeeds in returning home safely, and he delivers the sword to the National Museum of China as a national treasure. His action angered Professor Koo, the leader of the syndicate that has been funding Jack and William's treasure hunt.\nAfter extensive research, Jack and William conclude that the anti-gravity material is a fragment of a meteorite that fell to Earth during the Qin dynasty. They find the location of the Qin emperor's mausoleum, concealed behind a waterfall. The massive tomb contains the strongest fragment of the meteorite, powerful enough to make the tomb a floating palace. Jack meets Ok-soo and Nangong Yan alive inside the tomb, and they mistake him for Meng Yi. Professor Koo and his men enter and attempt to seize the immortality elixir, leading to an aerial fight between both parties. William accidentally breaks the balance of the field after removing a piece of the meteorite and causes the tomb to collapse on itself, and dies from drowning in mercury. While Jack is escaping from the collapsing tomb, he asks Ok-soo to come with him, but she refuses after realizing he is not Meng Yi and says she will wait for the real Meng Yi forever, believing he still lives. As Koo nears the elixir, Yan grabs onto him as they fall and presumably perish.\nJack is then seen at home with a published copy of The Myth, a book written by him about his adventure and his experiences which he dedicates to William.", "title": "The Myth (film)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q1195928"}}

It is during one of his tests with the invention running that Abe discovers that a protein inside the main unit has multiplied much more rapidly than it could in nature. Rather than the invention being a protein super incubator, Abe, using himself as a guinea pig, and a very meticulous one at that, discovers that the invention can be used as a time machine.

{"id": "tt0077588", "text": "In early April 1945, the Western Allied invasion of Germany meets fanatical Schutzstaffel resistance. Don \"Wardaddy\" Collier, a battle-hardened U.S. Army First Sergeant in the 2nd Armored Division, commands an M4 Sherman \"Easy Eight\" tank nicknamed Fury and its veteran crew: gunner Boyd \"Bible\" Swan, loader Grady \"Coon-Ass\" Travis, driver Trini \"Gordo\" Garcia, and assistant driver\u2013bow gunner \"Red,\" all of whom have fought together since the North African campaign. Red is killed by a German anti-tank shell, which went through his head hitting the gun mantlet. Red is replaced by Private First Class Norman Ellison, a young clerk typist from V Corps.\nAs Fury moves deeper into Germany, Norman's inexperience becomes dangerous: He spots but fails to shoot Hitler Youth child soldiers who ambush the platoon leader's tank with a Panzerfaust, killing its entire crew; later, he hesitates under fire during a skirmish with anti-tank guns. After the battle, Don finds a captured German soldier wearing a U.S. Army coat and gives Norman his M1917 Revolver, ordering him to execute the soldier. When he refuses, Don wrestles the revolver into his hand and forces him to pull the trigger, killing the prisoner and traumatizing Norman.\nWith Don now the acting platoon leader, the tanks capture a small town. Don and Norman search an apartment and encounter a German woman, Irma, and her younger cousin, Emma. Don pays them in cigarettes for a meal and some hot water so he can shave. Norman and Emma bond and, at Don's urging, go into the bedroom for sex. Later, as the four sit down to eat, the rest of the crew drunkenly barges in, harassing the women and bullying Norman (which Grady especially does), but they stop after Don berates them and spits at Grady. They are called away for an urgent mission but, as the men prepare to leave, German shells hit the town, killing Emma and Captain Waggoner, further traumatizing Norman.\nThe platoon receives orders to capture and hold a crossroads to protect the division's rear. En route, they are ambushed by an SS Tiger tank, which manages to destroy three U.S. tanks with its superior firepower and armor. Fury destroys the Tiger by outmaneuvering it and firing into its thinner rear armor. Unable to notify his superiors because the radio has been damaged, Don decides they must complete their mission rather than risk going back. Upon arriving at the crossroads, the tank is immobilized by a landmine. Don sends Norman to scout a nearby hill, from which he sees German soldiers approaching. Don identifies the Germans as a Waffen-SS battalion on their way to attack the division and decides to stay, informing the others they are permitted to leave if they want to. Norman volunteers to stay with Don and one by one the rest of the crew decide to stay and fight.\nThe men disguise Fury to appear destroyed and hide inside. While they wait, they give Norman the nickname \"Machine\" to show their acceptance of him and share their last bottle of liquor. Using the tank as cover, they inflict heavy casualties with small-arms fire over the course of a single day. Grady is killed by a Panzerfaust that penetrates the turret, Gordo is shot while unpinning a grenade and throws himself on it to protect the others, and a German sniper kills Bible and severely wounds Don. Norman wants to surrender, but Don warns him he will be tortured and killed if he does. Out of ammunition (except for Wardaddy's revolver) and surrounded, Don orders Norman to escape through the floor hatch as the Germans drop Stielhandgranate (potato-masher) grenades into the tank. Norman slips out just before they explode, killing Don. Norman tries to hide in the mud underneath the tank as the survivors move on, but is spotted by a young soldier who decides to not say anything, sparing Norman's life.\nThe next morning, Norman is awoken by the sound of a horse and crawls back into the tank to hide. While inside, he covers Don's body with his jacket and arms himself with the revolver. The hatch opens and Norman prepares to fight, but realizes that the soldiers outside the tank are American. As Norman is declared a hero and driven away, he looks back at the tank and numerous dead SS troops lying around it, while the rest of the force continues their march into the heart of Germany. The last scene is of Fury, heavily damaged from above, and the ambulance with Norman being the only survivor.", "title": "The Fury (film)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q626851"}}

After the interview, Darius is questioned by two government agents who have been following Kenneth and believe that he may be a spy because of his communication with government scientists. They know Kenneth has been breaking into labs and stealing equipment.\nDarius returns to Kenneth's house to confront him, but Kenneth rationalizes Belinda is now alive because his time travel mission succeeded. Jeff runs in to warn them that the government agents are also on the property. Kenneth panics and runs into the woods. Darius follows Kenneth, who has boarded his time machine, which has been integrated into a small boat on the lake. Darius apologizes for lying to Kenneth, tells him everything else they shared was real, and joins him on the boat. Kenneth tells Darius the his mission is now only to go back for her.

Later that night, Esther purposely breaks her arm and blames Kate, leading her to purchase two wine bottles. However, she resists drinking and empties one of the bottles. The next day, Esther releases the brake in the car, causing it to roll into oncoming traffic with Max inside. When Esther points out the wine bottle she found in the kitchen, John and Kate's therapist, Dr. Browning, suggest that Kate return to rehab, and John threatens to divorce her if she refuses. Kate later discovers that Esther came from an Estonian mental hospital and the orphanage Esther claims she was from has no records of her.\nWhen Daniel learns about Sister Abigail's death from Max and searches the treehouse, Esther sets it on fire, causing Daniel to fall, lose consciousness and be seriously injured. Esther attempts to kill him, but is prevented by Max. While Daniel is in the hospital, Esther smothers him. Kate, whose suspicions have been confirmed, has had enough and strikes her, but she is physically restrained and sedated. That night, Esther attempts to seduce a drunken John, who threatens to send Esther back to the orphanage for her behavior.\nAt the hospital, Kate is contacted by Dr. V\u00e4rava of the Saarne Institute and learns that Esther is actually a 33-year-old woman named Leena Klammer born in Estonia in the Soviet Union. She has hypopituitarism, a rare hormonal disorder that stunted her physical growth and caused proportional dwarfism, and she has spent most of her life posing as a little girl. Kate is also told that Leena has murdered at least seven people, including the last family that adopted her, after failing to seduce her adoptive father, and that the ribbons Esther wears around her wrists and neck have been hiding scars from trying to break out of a straitjacket. Meanwhile, Leena removes her disguise and stabs John to death, which Max witnesses. After Kate rushes home, Leena grabs a gun and attempts to shoot Kate, wounding her arm. Max seeks refuge in the greenhouse. Leena looks for any family member to shoot, and Kate tries to hide on top of the glass. After Leena begins to open fire at Max, Kate starts yelling and exposes her location to Leena. Leena then tries to shoot her, but Kate breaks through the roof and lands on top of her.\nKate and Max run away as the police arrive, but Leena attacks Kate near a frozen pond, knocking the gun away from Kate and hurling them onto the ice. Max tries to shoot Leena but shatters the ice, sending Leena and Kate underwater. Kate climbs out, with Leena clinging to her legs. Leena, in a final desperate attempt, pleads with Kate to save her while hiding a knife behind her back. Kate screams at Leena that she's not her mother and kicks her in the jaw, breaking her neck and killing her. Leena sinks into the icy pond as Kate and Max meet up with the police.", "title": "Orphan (2009 film)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q387414"}}

Called in by local Police departments to assist in solving crimes of a serial and/or extremely violent nature where the perpetrator is unknown (referred to by the Unit as the unknown subject or \"unsub\" for short), the B.A.U. uses the controversial scientific art of profiling to track and apprehend the unsub. Profiling entails coming up with basic characteristics of the unsub and the victims (referred to as the victimology), using evidence from the case and matching that information to historic precedents and psychological analyses as a means to solve the case. Because of the nature of the work conducted by the B.A.U. - the work being time consuming and psychologically demanding - its members are fiercely loyal to the Unit and to its other members. Also because of the work's overall demanding nature, not many members of the B.A.U. have been able to maintain a happy or stable family life.::Huggo\n\nIn this crime series, a crack team of F.B.I. profilers fly from Quantico to the focal point of the criminal activity of various serial killers.

After stealing the disk, Quint is pursued by Marvin Ringer (Lee Ving), another former thief and acquaintance who works for the company. At the same time, a prototype vehicle called the Black Moon, which can reach speeds of 325 miles per hour (523 km/h) and runs on tap water, is being tested in the desert by Earl Windom (Richard Jaeckel). Quint and Windom later cross paths at a gas station, where Quint hides the disk in the back bumper of the Black Moon. Windom is hauling the Black Moon to Los Angeles, and Quint, still being pursued by Ringer and his men, follows Windom and his team there.\nIn L.A., Quint meets with FBI agent Johnson (Bubba Smith) and demands double pay and a clean passport so he can retire since he is now dealing with Ringer. Quint tails Windom and the Black Moon to a posh restaurant, where Windom is negotiating a deal to sell the prototype to a car manufacturer. Before Quint can get to the disk, a group of auto thieves, led by Nina (Linda Hamilton), steals all of the cars in the parking lot, including the Black Moon off of its trailer. Quint gives chase, and tracks the cars to an office tower, but loses them in the parking garage. Inside the garage, Quint is seen on the security cameras, but no-one recognizes him. Back at the restaurant, Quint is warned by Johnson that he will not get paid and the government's case against The Lucky Dollar will be thrown out of court unless the disk is returned within three days. Quint then goes to Windom and his team and asks for their help in getting the car back, but they refuse, insisting that they go to the police first.\nAfter getting the blueprints for the towers from city hall, Quint begins staking them out. The Ryland Towers are a pair of office buildings built by Ed Ryland (Robert Vaughn), who is also the head of the stolen car syndicate. The basement of the towers is a large chop shop, and Ryland keeps the best cars for himself and sells the rest. He scolds Nina for stealing a car he does not want and cannot possibly resell, but he also will not allow her to keep it for herself. After seeing Nina leave the towers, Quint follows her to a nightclub. At the club, they meet and go to her apartment. They have sex, then he asks her to help him get the car back; to which she does not respond. Later, Windom and his team go to the towers to look for evidence to give to the police. Ryland's goons kill one of the team members, so they go back to Quint and offer their assistance. Meanwhile, Ringer has tracked down Quint, and he and his men attack him, demanding the return of the disk. Quint is able to kill two of the henchmen, but Ringer gets away.\nThe next day, Nina is summoned by Ryland who confronts her with the tape of Quint outside of the garage, and a tape of them having sex. Deeming her a traitor, he locks her in the closet. Meanwhile, Quint and Windom determine that since the chop shop entrance is impenetrable from the garage, the best way to get in is through the unfinished, unsecured second tower. While Windom destroys the security cameras, Quint goes up the empty tower, crosses over to the other one, and heads down. While descending down a ventilation shaft, he discovers Nina in the locked closet and gets her out. She then agrees to help Quint steal the Black Moon. After knocking out a guard and stealing his uniform, Quint and Nina enter the chop shop and take the Black Moon. Ryland has since learned that Nina is no longer locked up and sees her in the garage. Windom is on the other side of the garage door and blows a hole in it with C-4, but emergency bars drop down to cover the hole in the door, stopping Quint and Nina from escaping.\nQuint drives the Black Moon into the freight elevator, which takes them to Ryland's office. During the chase on that floor, Nina activates the turbo boost that makes the car reach its top speed. The car then shoots towards a window, hitting and killing Ryland instantly. The car then goes through the window and flies into the unoccupied building. Just as they think they are safe and Quint gets the disk out from the bumper, Ringer shows up to retrieve it. He and Quint start fighting just as Johnson shows up. After a brutal fistfight, Quint knocks out Ringer and takes back the disk and gives it to Johnson, allowing himself to retire. Windom then shows up and is grateful his car is still in one piece, but wonders how they will get it down. The movie ends back at Nina's apartment, where Quint asks her if she is happy she stole the Black Moon.

The survivors include brothers Barnaby (Bill Fraser) and Swallow Bath (Kenneth Connor), Lomax (Allan Cuthbertson), Helena Beckett (Nanette Newman) and her son, and Senator Robert Fraser (Chuck Connors).\nNemo takes them on a city scuba tour, but Lomax attempts to steal diving gear and escape but is caught. Fraser seems taken with a musical performance given by the city's swimming teacher Mala (Luciana Paluzzi), this noted by Joab, Nemo\u2019s second in command (John Turner).\nJoab shows the Bath brothers how the city makes oxygen and fresh water and as a by-product gold, which is even thrown away. Joab advises them that no one has ever escaped Templemer. Lomax sees the oxygen machine as a means to escape by rupturing the city's dome. Lomax attempts this but only manages to flood the machine\u2019s control room killing himself in the process. During this episode, the Bath brothers  sneak into the Forbidden Area where they discover a second submarine, the  Nautilus II, and see it as a means of escape.\nEnlisting Fraser to aid them, Fraser learns how to operate the submarine. During training they ram and kill a vast Manta Ray-like creature accidentally created during the building of the city. Fraser tells Nemo he should leave as he is attempting to cut off the supply of weapons to the American Civil War. Nemo refuses but offers Fraser a position at Templemer. This alienates Joab, who helps Fraser and the Baths steal Nautilus II, on condition they leave without bloodshed, and allow the crew to return with the submarine intact.\nThey manage to take the submarine and are followed by Nemo in his submarine. Nemo explains there is fault with the Nautilus II's engines that means the sub could explode. The chase is brief. Unable to match the speed of the escaping submarine, Nemo has Nautilus I sheer away, to try 'going under the reef.' Confused by their pursuers apparently giving up, Fraser asks the Nautilus II's first mate if there is 'a shorter way,' and is told 'yes, there is,' but that 'this ship is too large!'\nA now desperate Fraser gives orders for 'crash speed.' As the submarine increases to flank an explosion causes the engines to fail, and out of control the ship strikes a reef before coming to a stop whilst still submerged. The crew with Fraser and the Baths put on diving gear and attempt to escape from the now flooding submarine, but Barnaby panics (weighed down by too much stolen gold by-product) and drowns in the attempt.\nNautilus I approaches the wreck just in time to be buffeted violently as the bigger ship explodes; Joab is electrocuted as he is thrown against a control panel. Mortally wounded he confesses to Nemo that he helped Fraser to escape. Helena Beckett admits that she knew of the attempt, and that she and her son chose to stay. Mala reads Nemo a letter that Fraser left behind, in which he thanks Nemo for offering him a place in the city's future, but that he cannot accept, as he believes in his mission, and the 'slower, more painful process' towards peace.\nThe film closes as Nautilus turns towards Templemer. On the surface, a small schooner is seen picking up two men in mid-ocean, far from either land or any sign of wreckage. Fraser and Swallow Bath, huddled in blankets, are made welcome aboard, and as the schooner prepares to set sail, Fraser finds his companion has concealed a gold ladle under his coat.

{"id": "tt0116908", "text": "Samantha Caine (Geena Davis) is a schoolteacher in small-town Honesdale, Pennsylvania, living with her boyfriend Hal (Tom Amandes) and her daughter Caitlin (Yvonne Zima). Eight years earlier, she was found washed ashore on a New Jersey beach, pregnant with Caitlin and totally amnesiatic. Having never remembered her real name, \"Samantha\" has hired a number of ineffective private investigators to discover her past, the latest being a lowlife named Mitch Henessey (Samuel L. Jackson). During the Christmas holidays, Samantha is involved in a car accident and suffers a brief concussion; when she recovers, she finds she possesses skills with a knife that she cannot explain. Shortly thereafter, the family home is broken into by \"One-Eyed Jack\" (Joseph McKenna), a convict who escaped from jail after seeing Samantha's face on television. Samantha demonstrates her fighting prowess by killing Jack bare-handed. Worried that she poses a danger to Hal and Caitlin, Samantha leaves with Mitch, who has found a suitcase belonging to her, to seek out answers.\nThe suitcase contains a note directing them to Dr. Nathan Waldman (Brian Cox). They arrange to meet at a train station, unaware that government agents are tapping the doctor's calls. En route, Samantha discovers the bottom of the suitcase contains a disassembled sniper rifle which she can expertly reassemble, along with other weapons. When Samantha and Mitch go to meet Waldman at the station, they are attacked by a team of agents who shoot numerous bystanders, but the two escape with Waldman's help. The doctor informs Samantha that she is really an expert CIA assassin, Charlene Elizabeth \"Charly\" Baltimore, who had disappeared eight years prior. Unsure if they can trust Waldman, Samantha and Mitch leave him behind and seek another contact named on a note in the suitcase, Luke (David Morse), believing he may be Charly's fianc\u00e9.\nWaldman catches up with them and tries to warn them that Luke is actually Charly's last assassination target, \"Daedalus\". However, Luke kills Dr. Waldman, then straps Samantha to a waterwheel and tortures her by repeatedly submerging her in cold water. After being tortured, she is finally jolted into remembering her past life. Samantha frees herself, kills Luke, and escapes with Mitch. Samantha completes her physical transformation back to Charly, cutting her hair and dying it platinum blonde. Charly realizes that her \"Samantha Caine\" personality was a cover to get near to Daedalus eight years earlier.\nA psychological-operations specialist named Timothy (Craig Bierko), with whom Charly once had a romantic relationship, kidnaps Caitlin. Charly and Mitch learn about Daedalus' involvement in \"Project Honeymoon\", which she disrupted on her mission, resulting in One-Eyed Jack's incarceration; \"Project Honeymoon\" was intended to be a false flag chemical bomb detonation in Niagara Falls, planned by the CIA in an attempt to blame Islamic terrorists and secure more funding. Charly realizes that Timothy and a new group is plotting to restage the attack, led by CIA Director Leland Perkins (Patrick Malahide). In Niagara Falls, where Timothy has taken Caitlin, he captures Mitch and Charly. She tells Timothy that he is Caitlin's biological father and implores him not to hurt their daughter, but Timothy is ultimately unmoved, locking Charly and Caitlin in a freezer to kill them.\nCharly and Caitlin break out of the freezer by detonating barrels of kerosene and then freeing Mitch, who helps Charly attack the staging area. This forces Timothy to launch the attack early; meanwhile, Caitlin locks herself in a cage on the truck carrying the bomb. Charly chases the truck, overpowers its driver, diverts it from a Christmas parade, and overturns it on the Niagara Falls International Bridge leading to Canada. Charly frees Caitlin but they cannot get away from the bomb, which is about to explode, as Timothy and his agents attack them from a helicopter. Mitch suddenly arrives in a car, picking up Charly and Caitlin and entering Canada just before the bomb explodes, which kills Timothy and his forces and destroys the bridge.\nIn an epilogue, Charly has returned to her assumed identity of Samantha Caine, moving with Caitlin and Hal to a remote farmhouse and declining an offer from the president to join the state department (which could imply rejoining the CIA). Mitch enjoys the publicity attracted by his role in the crisis and is interviewed by Larry King on television about Perkins, who was indicted for treason.", "title": "The Long Kiss Goodnight", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q1168399"}}

God appears in the form of various people including small children, teenage boys, elderly ladies, transients, or passersby. Joan is asked by God to perform tasks that often appear to be trivial or contrary, but always end up positively improving a larger situation.\nOne of the more obvious effects of Joan's actions occurs when she is asked to take a reclusive bully to the school dance. While both her mother and the assistant principal object, Joan follows through with God's task. At the dance, it is revealed that the bully has a bottle of alcohol with him, but Joan convinces him not to open it. Despite this, the assistant principal later reaches into his jacket, finds the alcohol and expels him. In his anger, the boy threatens the chief of police (Joan's father) with a handgun, and he is then arrested. Joan later finds out from God that, while this turn of events seems rather bleak, it was the lesser of two evils\u2014without Joan's actions, he would have shot over a dozen students and teachers with a handgun, before turning the gun on himself. This ending is noticeably more direct than most episodes, since it is the only time God comments so clearly on \"what would have happened\" rather than primarily allowing events to speak for themselves.\nThe series starred actors Joe Mantegna and Mary Steenburgen as Joan's parents Will and Helen, Jason Ritter as her paraplegic older brother Kevin, and Michael Welch as her younger brother Luke. The family relationships and plot situations were written more realistically than other shows with spiritual themes. Various storylines that spanned multiple episodes dealt with the consequences of Kevin's accident, Will's job as a police officer, Helen's career as an art teacher, and Luke's aspirations to be a scientist. God quotes Bob Dylan, Emily Dickinson and the Beatles rather than any scripture or verses. Furthermore, God is portrayed with a very human personality. In \"Touch Move\", he tells Joan that he has to send her \"down there\", and laughs when she becomes worried he means Hell, when he meant the school basement. Also, in one episode, he hands Joan a book from a store they have just left. When Joan accuses him of stealing, he remarks \"Well, technically everything's mine\".\nChristopher Marquette also stars as Adam Rove, a close friend of Joan's who has an on-and-off romantic relationship with her.

The two plot lines are told in parallel through flashbacks.\nIn 2002, software engineer Alan Russell moves into a new house with his wife Marie, 10-year-old son Tim, and 12-year-old daughter Kaylie. Alan purchases an antique mirror to decorate his office. Unbeknownst to them, the mirror supernaturally induces hallucinations. Marie is haunted by visions of her own body decaying, while Alan is seduced by a mysterious and ghostly woman named Marisol Chavez, who has mirrors in place of eyes.\nOver time, the parents become psychotic; Alan isolates himself in his office, and Marie becomes withdrawn and paranoid. All of the plants in the house die, and their family dog Mason disappears after being shut in the office with the mirror. After Kaylie sees Alan with Marisol, she tells her mother, and the parents fight. One night, Marie goes insane and attempts to kill her children, but Alan locks her away. When the family runs out of food, the children realize that their father is under the influence of the mirror, so Kaylie goes to seek help from their mother, and finds her chained to the wall, acting like an animal. Kaylie and Tim try going to their neighbors for help, but the neighbors disbelieve their stories. When Kaylie attempts to use the phone, she discovers that all of her phone calls are answered by the same man.\nOne night, Alan unchains Marie, and both parents attack the children. Marie briefly comes to her senses, only to be shot dead by Alan. The children try to destroy the mirror but it tricks them, making them believe they are hitting the mirror when they are actually hitting the wall. Alan also experiences a moment of lucidity and kills himself by forcing Tim to pull the trigger of the gun and shoot him, causing a small crack in the corner of the mirror in the process. Before dying, he begs the children to run, but Marisol and other victims of the mirror appear as horrific ghosts. The police arrive and take Tim into custody. Before the siblings are separated, they promise to reunite as adults and destroy the mirror. As Tim is taken away, he sees the ghosts of his parents watching him from the house.\nIn 2013, Tim is discharged from a psychiatric hospital, having come to believe that there were no supernatural events involved in his parents' deaths. Kaylie has spent most of her young adulthood researching the history of the mirror. Using her position as an employee of an auction house, she obtains access to the mirror and has it transported to the family home, where she places it in a room filled with surveillance cameras and a \"kill switch\" \u2014 an anchor weighted to the ceiling. Kaylie intends to destroy the mirror, but first wants to document its powers, proving Tim's innocence.\nTim attempts to convince Kaylie that she's wrong and the siblings argue. When they notice the houseplants begin to wilt, they review the camera footage and see themselves performing actions they have no memory of. Tim finally accepts the mirror\u2019s supernatural power and attempts to escape the house with Kaylie, only for the pair to be drawn back by the mirror's influence. Seeing a hallucination of her mother, Kaylie stabs it in the neck, only to realize that she has stabbed Michael Dumont, her fianc\u00e9e who has come to check on her. They try to call the police, but are only able to reach the same voice who spoke to them on the phone as children.\nAt this point, they see their doppelgangers inside the house standing in front of the mirror. Realizing that the 9-1-1 call is not going through, they go back inside the house. Kaylie and Tim begin hallucinating by seeing younger versions of each other. They get separated, and each of them relives the nightmare from their youth. Tim awakens alone in the room with the mirror, while simultaneously a younger Kaylie hallucinates her mother beckoning her from the mirror.\nTim activates the kill switch, realizing too late and unable to see that Kaylie stood in its path, and he has killed her. The police arrive and arrest Tim, who is hysterical, just as they did when he was younger. As both a boy and an adult, Tim claims the mirror is responsible.

Pierre summons the local priest to the house for the baptism, but Pierre, by promising the priest repairs to his church and a new bell, performs the ritual himself so that the priest will not find out the truth about Mathurin.\nLucy and her aunt, Virginia, are driven by their chauffeur towards the farm but their way is blocked by a fallen tree. They find a back route to the house at a back door to the house, where Lucy asks Rammaendelo about rumors.

Wilbur needs to recover a time machine that a man wearing a bowler hat has stolen. Lewis tries to demonstrate the scanner, but it has been sabotaged by the Bowler Hat Guy and falls apart, throwing the science fair into chaos. Lewis leaves while the Bowler Hat Guy, with the help of a robotic bowler hat named Doris, repairs and steals the scanner.\nWilbur meets Lewis at the orphanage and asks him to repair the scanner. Lewis agrees to do so only if Wilbur can prove he is telling the truth, which Wilbur does by taking them in a second time machine to the year 2037, which is extremely advanced technologically. When they arrive, Lewis realizes he can simply use the time machine to meet his mother; the resulting argument makes them crash. Wilbur asks Lewis to fix the time machine, and Lewis agrees on the condition that Wilbur has to take him to visit his mother afterwards. Reluctantly, Wilbur agrees and hides Lewis in the garage. Lewis accidentally leaves, however, and ends up meeting the rest of the Robinson family except for Cornelius, Wilbur's father and the main creator of most of the time's inventions, who is away on a business trip. Having followed Lewis, the Bowler Hat Guy and Doris try to kidnap him, but the Robinsons beat them back.

Wilbur admits to lying to Lewis about taking him back to see his mom, causing Lewis to run off in disgust.\nThe Bowler Hat Guy and Doris approach Lewis and offer to take him to his mother if he fixes the memory scanner.

The Bowler Hat Guy reveals that Cornelius Robinson is, in fact, Lewis' future self, and that he himself is a grown-up version of Lewis' roommate, Michael \"Goob\" Yagoobian. Because he was kept awake by Lewis' work on the scanner, Goob fell asleep during an important Little League game and failed to make an important catch that cost the game.

Leaving Lewis behind, they take off with the scanner. However, it is revealed that Doris tricked everyone, and that by changing the past, Goob has allowed the mass-produced Doris hats to enslave humanity and render the future post-apocalyptic. Lewis repairs the second time machine, confronts Doris in the past and destroys her by promising to never invent her, restoring the future to its Utopian self. After persuasion from Lewis, Wilbur tries to ask the adult Goob to join the family, but he runs away, apparently ashamed by what he has done.\nBack in Wilbur's time, Lewis finally meets Cornelius face to face. Cornelius explains how the memory scanner started their successful career, and persuades Lewis to return to the science fair.

Malloy pursues the killer, only to find that he appears to have committed suicide. Three months later, Malloy descends into alcoholism. After a suicide attempt, Malloy's best friend and supervising officer, Agent Chuck Hendricks, enrolls Malloy in a rehabilitation program for law enforcement officers run by Dr. John \"Doc\" Mitchell, a former cop and recovering alcoholic.

Joanna, Bobbie, and Roger witness an incident in which Sarah Sunderson (Faith Hill), violently dances and then collapses.\nJoanna argues with Walter about the incident with Sarah. He tells her that her children barely know her, their marriage is falling apart, and she is so domineering that people literally want to kill her. Walter tries to walk out of their marriage, but Joanna appeases him by trying to fit in with the other Stepford wives.\nJoanna changes her look and tries to become a housewife. Joanna, Bobbie, and Roger go to Sarah's home to check up on her. Sarah has left the door open and they hear her upstairs, screaming in ecstasy while having sex with her husband. As they scramble to sneak out, they find a remote control labeled SARAH. They do not notice that pressing a button causes Sarah's breasts to enlarge and makes her walk backwards robotically. They run away to Bobbie's messy, disorderly home. Roger confides to them that he and his husband are having marital issues and went to Stepford to get better like Bobbie (court order), Joanna (as a last resort) and their husbands.\nThe Stepford women appear extremely vapid and shallow; in the Stepford book club, their \"story\" is a catalogue of Christmas, Hanukkah collectibles, and decoration tips.

Joanna wants to leave and Walter agrees with her, saying that they will go the next day. At night, a robo-dog gives her a remote with her name. Joanna goes into Walter's study and discovers that all the Stepford wives were once working women in high power positions and that a champion terrier vanished and is believed to be the robo-dog.\nThe next day, Joanna visits Bobbie and she notices that her house is spotless. Bobbie is now blonde, dressed in a Sunday dress, and blends in with the other Stepford wives. Bobbie says that she is a whole new person and the most important thing is her cookbook. While telling Joanna that she can help her change, Bobbie puts her hand over the stove's burner and does not even notice.\nJoanna wants to leave and calls the camp for her kids, but she finds out that they were taken by Walter. She goes back to the Men's Association and finds that in her family picture, she now looks like a Stepford wife. Walter has gathered with the other husbands and confesses that after marrying Joanna, he has felt undermined and all the husbands feel the same. Mike (Christopher Walken) shows how they insert nanochips into their wives' brains and turn them into Stepford wives. The men corner Joanna and Walter and force them toward the transformation room, but before Joanna enters, she makes a final appeal by asking whether the new wives really mean it when they tell their husbands that they love them.\nThe next scene shows all of the Stepford wives, including Joanna (secretly having never received the microchip implant), now blonde and dressed in Sunday dresses, at the grocery store.\nWith Joanna and Walter as the guests of honor, Stepford hosts a formal ball.

Walter returns to the transformation room, where he destroys the software that makes the women obedient. Walter returns to the ball, where the baffled husbands are cornered by their vengeful wives. Walter reveals that Joanna never received the microchip implant because her argument during the struggle had won him over. Out of his love for and loyalty to the human being he married, he joined her plan to infiltrate Stepford, with her pretending to be a cyborg. Mike threatens Walter, but before Mike can attack, Joanna hits Mike with a candlestick, decapitating him and revealing that he is a robot, and not even partially biological.\nClaire (Glenn Close) explains that she created Stepford because she, too, was a bitter, career-minded woman; in her case, a tired brain surgeon. When she discovered that Mike was having an affair with her research assistant, she murdered them in a jealous rage. When Joanna wonders aloud why Claire did not simply make the men into cyborgs, she replies that she planned to turn the whole community into cyborgs.

apparent widow Laurel (Foster) is quite content in his absence, because Jack was an unpleasant and abusive husband.\nShe even makes remarriage plans with one of her neighbors, Orin Meacham (Pullman), who despite his own hardships (such as a wooden foot, which he wears to replace one that was lost in the war) has been helping her and her young son with the farmwork.\nOne day, Jack seemingly returns with a complete change of heart.\nHe is now kind and loving to Laurel and their young son, Rob.\nIn the evenings, he reads to them from Homer's Iliad, which the old Jack never would have done.\nHe claims that the book was given to him by a man he met in prison, and that \"War changes you; makes you appreciate things\".\nJack and Laurel rekindle their intimacy, which leads to Laurel becoming pregnant.\nDisplaced from his courtship of Laurel, Meacham immediately suspects Jack as an impostor.\nThe town shoemaker also finds that this man's foot is two sizes smaller than the last which had been made for Sommersby before the war.\nIn order to revive the local economy, Jack suggests Burley tobacco as a cash crop.\nHe raises the seed money by selling parts of his own farm to people who will then work the land to grow tobacco.\nThis raises further doubts in his old neighbors who believe that the \"old\" Jack would not be so hasty to give away his beloved father's land, as well as resentment among Confederate veterans about the inclusion of former slaves.\nOne black freedman living on Sommersby's land is brutally attacked and dropped at Sommersby's door, by men proclaiming themselves the Knights of the White Camellia (one of them is Meacham, distinguished by his wooden foot).\nJack is threatened in an attempt to force him to exclude Black people from the landowning but he refuses, saying that they can \"own what they pay for\".\nUpon taking the townspeople's money, he sets off to buy the tobacco seed claiming that the crops will raise enough funds to rebuild the town church.\nGreat suspicion and skepticism falls upon him (and by association, Laurel and their son) when he does not return at the expected time.\nHe does, however, return.\nAll those that bought

twoS.\nMarshals appear in town to arrest Jack on the charge of murder, which carries the death penalty if convicted.\nOnce the trial begins, Laurel's attempts to save her husband quickly focus on the question of his identity: whether this \"Jack\" is who he claims to be, or a lookalike who met the real Sommersby whilst in prison for deserting the Confederate Army.\nLaurel and Jack's lawyer agree to argue that her husband is an impostor, not the same man who left Laurel to fight in the war.\nThis would save her husband (or supposed husband) from hanging for murder, but he would still be imprisoned for several years for fraud and military desertion.\nMeacham devises this plan in exchange for Laurel promising to marry him upon \"Sommersby's\" imprisonment.\nJack fires the lawyer and sets about re-establishing himself as the real Sommersby.\nSeveral witnesses are brought up to discredit this Sommersby as a fraud, who state that he is one Horace Townsend, an English teacher and con artist from Virginia.\nOne witness says that the man currently posing as Jack defrauded his township of several thousand dollars after claiming he wanted to help rebuild the schoolhouse there.\nHe is also said to have deserted the Confederate Army and ended up in prison.\nSommersby quickly discredits the man's testimony by identifying him as one of the Klansmen who had threatened him earlier.\nHe points out that Orin Meacham was another of those men, and that this is all a set-up to try to rob the new black farmers of the land they have bought.\nWhen the black judge, Barry Conrad Isaacs (Jones), confronts him, the witness snaps, \"When the Yankees have all gone you'll be back in the field where you belong.\n\" The judge sentences him to 30 days for contempt, increased to 60 days upon the man's protest.\nWhen Laurel is called as a witness, Jack asks her to give the reason she knows he is not the \"real\" Jack, and Laurel reveals his kind nature is what convinced her of his being an impostor, admitting \"\u2026because I never loved him the way I love you.\n\" With this, she says that she believes the man before her to be her real husband.\nJudge Isaacs calls Jack to his bench to ask whether he wishes to be tried as Jack Sommersby, even if it will certainly mean death by hanging.\nJack glances at the freed blacks who have been farming his land, and then he glances at his wife and his daughter, who would be respectively condemned as an adulteress and a bastard child if he claimed the identity of Horace Townsend.\nHe calmly states that he wants to be tried as John \"Jack\" Sommersby.\nJack is convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death by hanging.\nWhile awaiting death, he is asked by Laurel to tell the truth about his identity and Horace Townsend.\nLaurel

four years, they got to know everything about each other.\nUpon his release, Jack Sommersby killed another man, then died from a wound he got during the fight.\nHorace Townsend then buries Jack Sommersby, which is seen in the opening scene of the film.\nWhen Laurel asks him \"You mean you buried Jack,\" he answers \"I buried Horace\".\nHorace Townsend decided to assume Jack Sommerby's identity, and no longer be the man he was.\nLaurel begs him to tell the truth, pleading for him to return home with her.\nJack concludes by saying he can't admit to being Horace, because Laurel and the children would lose everything.\nAs Jack is taken to the gallows, he asks Laurel to be amongst the crowds, as he cannot \"hang alone\".\nAs Jack is about to be hanged, Laurel makes her way to the

As many of Jacob's comrades are killed or wounded, others exhibit abnormal behavior with some suffering catatonia, convulsions, and seizures. Jacob flees into the jungle, only to be stabbed with a bayonet by an unseen assailant.\nJacob awakens in the New York City Subway, where, after glimpsing what he believes to be a tentacle protruding from a sleeping homeless person, an inexplicably locked subway station exit results in him almost being hit by a train. The year is 1975, he works as a postal clerk, and lives in a rundown apartment in Brooklyn with his girlfriend, Jezebel. Jacob misses his old family and experiences visions of them, especially the youngest of his sons, Gabe, who had died in an accident before the war. Jacob is increasingly beset by disturbing experiences and apparitions, including glimpses of faceless vibrating figures, and narrowly escapes being run over by a pursuing car. He attempts to contact his regular doctor at the local VA hospital, but after first being told that there is no record of him ever being  a patient there, Jacob is told that his doctor has died in a car explosion.\nAt a party thrown by friends, a psychic reads Jacob's palm and tells him that he is already dead, which Jacob dismisses as a joke. After declining to dance with her, he appears to witness an enormous creature penetrating Jezzie before he collapses. At home, Jacob experiences a dangerous fever, which Jezzie attempts to bring down with a painful ice bath. Jacob briefly wakes up in another reality where he lives with his wife and sons, including a still-alive Gabe. First-person perspective scenes of apparent flashbacks to his time in Vietnam show Jacob, badly wounded, being discovered by American soldiers before being evacuated under fire in a helicopter.\nOne of Jacob's former platoon mates, Paul, contacts him to reveal he is suffering from similar experiences, but is soon afterwards killed when his car explodes. Commiserating after the funeral, other surviving members of the platoon confess that they have all been experiencing horrifying hallucinations. Believing that they are suffering the effects of a military experiment performed on them without their knowledge or consent, they hire a lawyer to investigate. However the lawyer quits the case after reading military files documenting that the soldiers were never in combat and were discharged for psychological reasons. Jacob's comrades soon back down while Jacob suspects they have been threatened into doing so. He is abducted by suited men who try to intimidate him. Jacob fights them and escapes but is injured and nearly paralyzed in the process. He is taken to a nightmarish hospital, where he is told he has been killed and this is home, but his chiropractor friend Louis comes to his rescue and heals him. Louis quotes the 14th-century Christian mystic, Meister Eckhart:\n\nEckhart saw Hell too. He said: \"The only thing that burns in Hell is the part of you that won't let go of life, your memories, your attachments. They burn them all away. But they're not punishing you\", he said. \"They're freeing your soul. So, if you're frightened of dying and ... you're holding on, you'll see devils tearing your life away. But if you've made your peace, then the devils are really angels, freeing you from the earth.\"\nJacob is approached by a distressed man who was seen treating his wound in a medevac helicopter and who also dragged him away from Paul's burning car. Introducing himself as Michael Newman, he tells a story of having been a chemist with the Army's chemical warfare division where he designed a drug he called the Ladder, which massively increased aggression. Michael claims that, to test the drug's effectiveness, a dose was secretly given to Jacob's unit before the battle, causing some of them to turn on each other in a homicidal frenzy. Michael's story triggers a vision of Jacob's wounding in Vietnam, which shows his attacker as a fellow American soldier. Jacob returns to his family's home, where he finds Gabe, who takes him by the hand and leads him up the staircase into a bright light. The scene turns to a triage tent in 1971 as military doctors declare Jacob dead. The doctor notes that Jacob had put up a tremendous fight to stay alive, but looked peaceful in death.", "title": "Jacob's Ladder (1990 film)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q482626"}}

{"id": "tt0122356", "text": "In 1532 a Spanish orphan named Esteban joins Mendoza, a navigator, and his associates Sancho and Pedro, in their search for one of the Seven Cities of Gold in the New World, hoping to find his father. They are joined on their quest by Zia, an Incan girl (who was kidnapped by Gomez, Gaspard, Perez and Mendoza), and Tao, the last descendant of the sunken empire of Mu (Hiva in the English dub).\nThe series is a mix of ancient South American history, archaeology, and science fiction. The travellers encounter the Maya, Inca, and Olmecs during their journey. They discover many lost technological wonders of the Mu Empire, including a solar-powered ship (the Solaris) and The Golden Condor, a huge solar-powered ornithopter (mechanical bird), capable of traveling considerable distances under the sun's power alone. They are constantly pursued by antagonists Gomez and Gaspard, who are also in search of the Cities of Gold.\nThe Seven Cities of Gold were built by the Emperor of Hiva over fear of a global war which would destroy all civilization. Such a war did break out, destroying the Empires of Mu and Atlantis when they used the \"Weapons of the Sun\". The Seven Cities of Gold hold copies of books in their \"Universal Libraries\" as well as powerful artifacts, including the \"Great Legacy\", a portable fusion reactor. Other elements of this technology turn up in unexpected places, like the Solaris in Tao's home island, Esteban's and Zia's medallions as keys to the Cities, or Tao's jar as an important piece of the Great Legacy.\nReminiscences of this ancient story are present in Inca legends written on golden quipu, which only Zia can read. This triggers an obsessive quest for the Cities of Gold on the part of the Spaniards Mendoza, Gomez, Gaspard and Francisco Pizarro.\nEsteban seeks his long-lost father and is tied to Mendoza, who rescued Esteban from a sinking ship when he was a baby. Esteban seems to have a magical ability to make the Sun appear, which proves to be an invaluable asset throughout the series. Zia also seeks her father, from whom she was taken when she was seven and brought to Spain as a gift to the princess. She has a medallion just like the one Esteban carries.\nTao seeks signs of his ancestors. He possesses an encyclopedia about their lost technology and a mysterious jar which according to the legend, only the High Priest of the City of Gold can open and proves to be the Great Legacy's cooling or control rod system. Mendoza, Sancho and Pedro are motivated by their search for gold, though Mendoza appears to be genuinely fond of the three children.\nThe Olmecs are the descendants of survivors of the global war who hid under their mountain. Only their elite were able to survive, suspended in cryogenic hibernation. The Olmecs do not appear to be human\u2014or if they were once Human, it is implied that they have horribly mutated from the fallout of the nuclear war that destroyed their ancestors. They are short, thin and have pointed ears and enlarged frontal bones. They are highly intelligent but devious and selfish.\nLed by their king, Menator, the Olmecs seek an artifact called the \"Great Legacy\" in order to power their cryogenic systems, as well as samples of healthy cells from the children in order to combat their mutations and their sterility. Their technology is generally inferior to that of the modern age, and they use weapons such as spears and swords. They maintain some elements of their advanced technological heritage, such as the stasis and medical technology used to keep the elite of the Olmecs in suspended animation until an opportunity arises when they can be revived, powered by what appears to be a geothermal power system.\nThis power system is destroyed in an escape by the children and Mendoza, starting a frantic search by the Olmecs for the fusion reactor core (the Great Treasure) hidden in the City of Gold. They also have a single flying machine that appears to use very similar technology to that of the Golden Condor. It is armed with some kind of particle beam or focused heat weapon of great power.\nEventually the Olmecs succeed, at great cost, in taking control of the Great Legacy. It begins to melt down without the moderation provided by Tao's jar. The resulting earthquakes and volcanism destroy the City of Gold. A world-threatening meltdown is avoided by the personal sacrifice of Esteban's father who, acting as the High Priest of the Cities, is presumed to be dead after replacing the jar. At the end of the series Mendoza, Sancho, and Pedro, having salvaged some gold before the city's destruction, return to Spain\u2014while Esteban and his friends set out across the Pacific on the golden condor in search of the remaining Cities.", "title": "The Mysterious Cities of Gold", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q1218397"}}

Mussolini by Otto Skorzeny, a similar idea is considered by Hitler, with the support of Himmler (Donald Pleasence).\nAdmiral Canaris (Anthony Quayle), head of the Abwehr (German military intelligence), is ordered to make a feasibility study of the seemingly impossible task of capturing the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and bringing him to Germany.\nCanaris considers the idea a joke, but realises that although Hitler will soon forget the matter, Himmler will not.\nFearing Himmler may try to discredit him, Canaris orders one of his officers, Oberst Radl (Robert Duvall) to undertake the study, despite feeling that it is a waste of time.\nAn Unteroffizier on Radl's staff, Karl, finds that one of their spies, code named Starling, has provided tantalising intelligence: Winston Churchill is to visit an airfield near the (fictitious) village of Studley Constable in Norfolk, where Joanna Grey (Jean Marsh), a German sleeper agent lives.\nRadl comes up with a scheme that could work, called 'Eagle', where the kidnapping will proceed with German troops leading the action.\nHe also is convinced that 'synchronicity' is behind it all, where actions and conditions merge at the proper moment, at the proper time.\nHimmler summons Radl and unofficially tells him to proceed, without notifying Canaris but with Hitler's knowledge, providing Radl with an 'authorising' letter signed by Hitler himself.\nRadl recruits Liam Devlin (Donald Sutherland), a member of the IRA lecturing at a Berlin university, to the mission.\nRadl looks for a suitable officer to lead the mission and chances upon the highly decorated and experienced, but conflicted and anti-Nazi, Fallschirmj\u00e4ger officer Oberst Kurt Steiner (Michael Caine).\nWhile returning from the Eastern Front, Steiner intervened when SS soldiers rounded up Jews at a railway station in Poland, and attempted to save the life of a teenage girl who was shot while trying to escape.\nFor this, he was court-martialled, along with a platoon of his men.\nRather than face the firing squad, the men were allowed to transfer to a penal unit on the Channel Island of Alderney, where they made high risk attacks with Neger Manned Torpedoes against English Channel convoys.\nRadl travels to Alderney and, with the help of Devlin, recruits Steiner and his surviving men.\nThe team will parachute into England from a captured C-47 with Allied markings.\nThe commandos outfit themselves as Polish paratroopers, as few of them speak English.\nThe plan is to infiltrate Studley Constable, complete their mission, rendezvous with an E-boat on the nearby coast and escape.\nThe paratroopers land and the operation proceeds.\nRadl visits Himmler to announce that \"The eagle has landed\", but then Himmler destroys the authorising document he'd given Radl, suggesting that Himmler invented Hitler's approval.\nAs the Germans take up positions in the town, the plan is foiled when a paratrooper rescues a local girl from certain death by a water wheel.\nHe instead is killed in the process and his German uniform (worn under the Polish uniforms at the prior insistence of Steiner) is revealed to the onlooking villagers.\nThe locals are rounded up into the village church, but Pamela Vereker (Judy Geeson), the sister of the village priest Father Vereker (John Standing), escapes to alert a unit of the United States Army Rangers stationed nearby.\nInexperienced, glory-seeking Colonel Pitts (Larry Hagman) tries to foil the German plan almost single-handed but is killed by treasonous Nazi sympathizer Joanna Grey in her house, while his poorly-planned assault on the church fails with heavy casualties.\nPitt's young deputy, Captain Clark (Treat Williams) then organises a second, successful attack.\nSteiner's men sacrifice themselves to delay the Americans while Devlin, Steiner and his wounded second-in-command Neustadt (Sven-Bertil Taube) escape, with the aid of local girl Molly Prior (Jenny Agutter) who was romantically involved with Devlin.\nInstead of boarding the escape boat, Steiner vows to make one last attempt at Churchill.\nReceiving news by radio of the apparent failure of the operation, Radl orders his assistant Karl to leave Alderney immediately and return home to Germany, in order to avoid the fate Radl knows is forthcoming.\nRadl is then arrested and summarily executed by firing squad, under the pretext that he \"exceeded his orders to the point of treason\".\nIn this way Himmler distances himself from the failed mission.\nSteiner does manage to infiltrate the country house and apparently succeeds in killing Churchill before being shot and killed himself.\nCaptain Clark, on scene, is stunned by Churchill's death, but is then informed by security personnel that \"Churchill\" was actually George Fowler, an actor and impersonator \u2013 the real Prime Minister is at the Tehran Conference.\nClark and a superior officer are also advised that, \"No one will ever know about

Deputy Fuchs returns and attempts to save the women, but instead causes a gunfight, which Hel ends with a high-powered machine gun found in the nearby trailer.\nCamero asks the meaning of the code Hel uses on the bunker \"75650\". \nAt closer inspection it appears that the number 1 is associated with the letter A, 2 with BCD, 3 with E, 4 is with FGH, 5 is with IJK, 6 is with LMN, 7 is with OPQ, 8 is with RST, 9 is with UVW and 0 is with XYZ.\nWith this info the code numbers spell \"PINKY\" \nHel and Trixie find a hidden bunker full of goods stolen from Pinky, including a mysterious weapon, diamonds, and a beautiful sword, which Trixie takes. Camero, believing she is in the midst of a double-cross, fights Hel for the diamonds. Camero overcomes Hel and sets Trixie afire along with barrels of flammable liquids. Camero leaves Hel in chains while she attempts to drive away with the diamonds; however, Hel quickly uses the super-machine gun to free herself, and fires a rocket that destroys the car Camero was driving.\nHel admits to Trixie that she is a secret agent who reports to a man named Phoenix, and that she is on a mission to retrieve the weapon they found in Pinky's lair. Camero returns and again fights Hel. After she beats Hel to the ground, Camero assumes she is dead and moves to kill Trixie. As Trixie will not fight back, Camero tries to rape her, but stops when she sees a tattoo and realizes Trixie was the shadowy contortionist from her past. Before she can kill Trixie, Camero is shot in the back and killed by Deputy Fuchs, who managed to survive the explosion. However, instead of thanking him, Trixie kills Fuchs using a hidden throwing star. Hel awakens, having survived Camero's attack. Trixie then reveals that she, in fact, is Pinky, and concocted the entire plot to retrieve the sword she took from Gage's bunker, which he had taken from her six months previously.", "title": "Bitch Slap", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q878774"}}

Set seizes the throne and declares that mankind must pay riches to pass into the afterlife. Stripped of his eyes, Horus is exiled as Egypt is driven to its knees.\nOne year later, a thief named Bek is given the plans for Set's pyramid by his lover Zaya, a slave to chief architect Urshu. Bek steals one of Horus' eyes from Set\u2019s treasure vault, but is caught by Urshu. Zaya is killed, and Bek takes her body to Horus and gives him the eye, promising to find the other if he brings Zaya back from the dead.\nThey visit the divine vessel of Horus' grandfather Ra. Neutral about the conflict with Set, and at war with the shadow beast Apophis that threatens to devour the world, Ra does not restore Horus\u2019 power, but allows him to take a vial of divine waters to weaken Set. Ra explains that Horus\u2019 loss of his powers is the result of not fulfilling his destiny, which Horus believes means avenging his parents' deaths.\nSet asks Hathor to take him to the underworld, but she refuses and escapes. After an attack by Minotaurs led by Mnevis, followed by other minions and giant cobras, Hathor rescues Horus and Bek. Horus is mistrustful of Hathor, who claims Set is also her enemy. Bek and Horus explain their plan to infiltrate Set's pyramid, and Hathor warns of a guardian sphinx. They visit the library of Thoth to recruit the god to solve the sphinx\u2019s riddle. Overcoming the pyramid's traps, they reach the source of Set's power. Before they can use the divine water, Set traps them, destroying the divine water and taking Thoth's brain, but Horus saves Hathor and Bek. Sacrificing her own safety, Hathor gives Bek her bracelet as payment (for Zaya) for the afterlife and calls Anubis to take him to Zaya, letting herself be dragged to the underworld.\nAbsorbing Thoth's brain, Osiris's heart, Horus's other eye, and wings from Nephthys, Set confronts Ra about his mistreatments, which Ra explains were tests to prepare Set for his true role: taking Ra's place aboard his solar barge as defender of the world against Apophis. Dismayed, Set decides to destroy the afterlife to become immortal. Ra blasts him with his spear, but Set survives through his absorbed powers. He stabs Ra, taking his spear and casting him off the barge, freeing Apophis to consume the mortal and underworld realms.\nZaya refuses Hathor's gift, not wanting an afterlife without Bek. Apophis attacks, and the gate to the afterlife is closed. Bek returns to the mortal world, determined to stop Set and encouraging Horus that Zaya still had faith in him.\nHorus battles Set atop an obelisk, but is heavily outmatched. Bek throws Urshu to his death and joins the battle on the obelisk, removing Horus' stolen eye from Set's armor, but is mortally wounded. Sliding toward the edge of the obelisk, Bek throws the eye to Horus, who must choose either to catch it or to save Bek. Horus reaches for Bek, apologizing for all he has put him through. As they plummet toward the ground, Horus regains his power to transform, flying Bek to safety. Horus realizes that his true destiny was to protect his people. With renewed strength, Horus outmaneuvers and kills Set. Finding Ra wounded in the aether, Horus returns his spear, allowing Ra to repel Apophis, and Anubis to reopen the gates.\nA child in the crowd returns Horus' other eye and the god lays a dying Bek in Osiris's tomb beside Zaya. For his deeds, Ra offers to bestow Horus with any power, but all Horus wants is to bring Bek and Zaya back to life.

Drake is driven to alcoholism and Patty has a miscarriage.\nHayes visits the couple to offer his condolences, but an infuriated Drake attacks him and is arrested by the police, whom Hayes had already called to the scene in anticipation of an assault.\nThe assault allows Hayes to file a civil lawsuit against Drake and assume control of Drake's possessions and identity (although the couple are not immediately aware of this).\nHayes also files a restraining order, which forces Drake from the building.\nOnce Drake is gone, Hayes begins stalking and harassing Patty, in a ploy to lure Drake back to the building in violation of the restraining order.\nThe ploy succeeds, as Drake becomes increasingly leery and enters the building one night to check on Patty.\nHayes confronts Drake in the hallway and shoots him, then plants a crowbar at the scene to prevent any criminal charges.\nWhile Drake is recuperating in the hospital, the eviction is finally handed down and authorities force entry into Hayes' apartment.\nBy this time however, Hayes has vanished without a trace, and the apartment has been destroyed and stripped bare of all its appliances, light fixtures, wood paneling, and even the toilet.\nThis finally explains the frequent hammering and drilling noises, which Hayes had previously claimed were caused by his roommate's sculpting hobby, but which had actually been the two thieves' removing all the apartment's furnishings to sell on the black market.\nSome days later, while cleaning out the apartment, Patty finds an important clue: an old photograph of Hayes as a young boy.\nWritten on the back of the photograph is the name \"James Danforth\", which Patty correctly surmises is Hayes' real name.\nShe phones Bennett Fidlow (Jerry Hardin), the Texas attorney whom Danforth had provided as a reference when he first moved in (albeit under his Hayes alias).\nFidlow confides to her that Danforth has a long history of wrongdoing and has been disowned by his family.\nPatty travels to Danforth's last-known address, a condominium in Desert Spring.\nThere she finds Ann, his girlfriend and previous co-conspirator who had earlier come looking for him in San Francisco.\nAnn tells Patty that Carter Hayes is the name of the property's former landlord, and that Danforth assumed Hayes' identity and took possession of the condominium after (the genuine) Hayes hired two thugs to carry out the assault shown in the film's opening scene.\nAnn also shows Patty a postcard from Danforth, written on the letterhead of a hotel in Century City, which had arrived in the mail just the day before.\nPatty tracks down Danforth at the hotel, where he has checked in under Drake's name.\nPatty bluffs her way into his suite by posing as his wife, and while rummaging through his personal effects she discovers he is using legal and financial documents in Drake's name.\nShe calls Drake and tells him to cancel all of his credit cards and freeze the couple's joint bank account.\nShe then places an exorbitant order for room service, which leads to Danforth being arrested.\nDanforth is bailed out of prison by a wealthy widow, Florence Peters (played by Hedren), whom he was apparently vetting to be his next victim.\nOnce out on bail, Danforth returns to San Francisco to seek revenge against Patty and Drake.\nUpstairs, he bludgeons Drake with a golf club, then attacks Patty in the downstairs apartment where she is busy making repairs.\nA struggle ensues between Patty and Danforth, and a badly wounded Drake makes his way into the crawl space between the basement and the first-floor apartment.\nHe reaches through a hole in the floor and grabs Danforth by the ankle;

The convent is populated only by nuns, who practise strange rituals in the catacombs under the building and who seem to hold something at bay down there.\nA priest is shown in a church studying a strange ancient book. Outside there a violent storm is raging. The church begins to collapse and the priest is impaled by the spike on top of a fallen crucifix. Later, a nun is shown bearing a strange pagan amulet to the edge of the sea. As she stands on the cliff she is approached from behind by someone or something that frightens her so much that she falls to her death. The amulet she was carrying is smashed on the rocks but its pieces are shown being recovered by someone who is not identified.\n20 years later a young heiress from London, Elizabeth, is traveling to a remote convent to visit her friend. She is shown on a rustic country bus that is full of strange characters.\nMeanwhile, a young girl in a novice nun's cassock is shown entering a catacomb through a crack in a wall. She watches a sinister ritual where nun's beat themselves with whips and lay face down on the ground in some sort of pattern. The girl is then attacked from behind by someone with a knife. While the ritual continues below the girl is repeatedly stabbed. Her blood flows into a stream which pours out over a large crucifix.\nElizabeth arrives at her destination during a heavy rainstorm (which continues through much of the movie) and has to deal with various creepy or insane locals before she finds someone willing to take her on a boat to the island where the convent is located. Elizabeth is greeted by the nuns and taken to the ancient Mother Superior who is blind and communicates through an assistant. She tells the Mother Superior that she is there to see why her father donated money to the convent and if she is willing to continue the charity.\nShe is provided with a room but all her possessions are confiscated until she decides to leave. Shortly after she is befriended by a seemingly innocent novice, Sarah, who is appointed to act as her guide during her stay. Sarah tells her that the friend she came to visit has left the convent and returned to London. Elizabeth reveals to Sarah that she was actually born on the island and lived there until she was seven.\nElizabeth and Sarah visit the decaying library of the convent. There they discover an ancient book with sinister images of a demonic creature. They also find a strange painting that features a pair of young girls and a pagan amulet. While Sarah is out of the room looking for more light Elizabeth is attacked by one of the nuns. Elizabeth narrowly escapes when the nun accidentally falls to her death out of an open window.\nElizabeth then discovers an entrance into a labyrinth of catacombs beneath the convent. There she spies on a strange procession of nuns carrying burning crosses and a bloody corpse wrapped in a sheet. While following this procession Elizabeth gets lost and wanders into a pit-like room where a blind painter has covered the walls and canvases with enigmatic images. She recognizes one of the faces on the wall as that of her missing friend and realizes that the body the nuns were carrying might well have been hers.\nThe next day she sees a boat leaving the island despite Sarah having told her that there would be no way to reach the mainland for several days.\nElizabeth begins to suspect that Sarah might not be as friendly as she appears. She also starts having strange dreams and visions. One involves seeing a crucified nun accompanied by two small girls. Later, she finds the beach covered by thousands of dead fish, in which she begins eating one of the fish before coming to her senses and vomiting. While wandering on the beach one of the villagers shows Elizabeth some photos of her childhood on the island which include another little girl and what seems to be Elizabeth's mother, who had supposedly died in childbirth. Elizabeth goes to her childhood home and questions the old woman who cared for her as a child. Their meeting is interrupted by the nuns when they set fire to the house. Elizabeth escapes but the old woman is hideously burned. Meanwhile, Sarah is shown uncovering a piece of the shattered pagan amulet shown in the painting. A nun comes up to stab her but is later shown cut to ribbons and nailed to a chair. The blind painter gives a painting of Elizabeth to the Mother Superior. The old blind woman begins to smudge off the wet paint and reveals a demonic face underneath.\nElizabeth makes her way back to the convent. There are dead and dying nuns everywhere. She is attacked by a nun wielding a huge knife but she manages to kill her by bashing her head on the stone floor. Elizabeth descends into the catacombs where she finds more dead nuns. The blind painter is shown using the Mother Superior's blood to paint more strange images on the wall. Elizabeth is then approached by Sarah, who removes the top of her cassock to reveal that much of her body is not human at all. She is not entirely human.\nIt is revealed that Sarah is Elizabeth's sister but that she more closely resembles their mother. Their mother is actually the demon depicted in the book and on the pagan amulet. The nuns were trying to prevent Elizabeth from realizing her heritage and attempting to free her demon-mother from the walled up crypt she is trapped in. The two women had previously tried to free their demon-mother when they were children but Elizabeth had gotten scared and ran away. She and her father fled the island but it is presumed Sarah has been there ever since, waiting for her to return and complete the ceremony.\nNow the grown-up Sarah and Elizabeth begin the ritual again. The pieces of the shattered amulet are placed on the ground by a captured nun. Elizabeth eviscerates the nun and the falling blood causes the broken amulet to become whole again. The women raise the blood-soaked amulet and their demon-mother begins to break free of her prison.\nJust like before Elizabeth becomes terrified and throws the amulet, shattering it into pieces again. Sarah goes to the demon-mother while Elizabeth runs away.\nAt the end of the movie Elizabeth is shown on the beach of the island. She is now in a nun's habit and putting on a necklace made of the center fragment of the shattered amulet. Her white eyes now look like those of the blind Mother Superior's.

{"id": "tt0189998", "text": "In 1921, German director F. W. Murnau is shooting Nosferatu, an unauthorized version of Bram Stoker's novel Dracula. Murnau keeps his team in the dark about their schedule and the actor playing the vampire Count Orlok. It is left to the film's other main actor, Gustav von Wangenheim, to explain that the lead is an obscure German theater performer named Max Schreck, who is a character actor. To involve himself fully in his role, Schreck will only appear amongst the cast and crew in makeup, will only be filmed at night, and will never break character.\nAfter filming scenes in a studio with leading actress Greta Schr\u00f6der, who is displeased about leaving Berlin, Murnau takes his cast and crew to a remote inn in Czechoslovakia to film on-location. The landlady becomes distressed at Murnau removing crucifixes around the inn, and the cameraman, Wolfgang Muller, falls into a strange, hypnotic state. Gustav discovers a bottle of blood amongst the team's food supplies, and someone delivers a caged ferret in the night to a not yet fully revealed Shreck.\nOne night, Murnau rushes his team up to a nearby, old Slovak castle for the first scene with the vampire. Schreck appears for the first time, and his appearance and behavior impress and disturb them. The film's producer, Albin Grau, is confused when Murnau tells him that he originally found Schreck in the castle. Soon after the completion of the scene, Wolfgang is found collapsed in the tunnel into which Schreck had receded.\nWhilst filming a dinner scene between Gustav and Orlok, Murnau accidentally cuts his finger. Schreck reacts wildly and tries drinking from Gustav's wound. The lights fail and when they return, Schreck is at Wolfgang's neck. Albin orders filming ended for the night, and the crew rushes from the castle, leaving Schreck behind. Alone, Schreck examines the camera equipment, fascinated by footage of a sunrise. With Wolfgang near death, Murnau is forced to bring in another cinematographer, Fritz Arno Wagner, after chastising Schreck in private for attacking his crew members and threatening him with harm if he does not control himself in Murnau's absence\u2014a threat that Schreck challenges due to his immortality. \nWhile Murnau returns to Berlin to calm financiers of the film, Schreck approaches Albin and the screenwriter, Henrik Galeen. They believe he is still in character, and Schreck points out Dracula's loneliness and the sadness of him trying to remember how to do otherwise mundane chores that he has not needed to perform for centuries. When they ask how he became a vampire, Schreck says it was a woman. Schreck snatches a bat and viciously sucks its blood. Grau and Galeen, thanks to their drunkenness on schnapps, are impressed by what they assume is talented acting. Later that night, Schreck attacks and kills a crew member on the film's set.\nThe production moves to the island of Heligoland to film the final scenes, and Murnau, in a laudanum-induced stupor, admits to Albin and Fritz that Schreck is an actual vampire, and in return for his cooperation, Murnau has promised him Greta. The two realize they are trapped on the island, leaving no choice but to complete the film tonight.\nOn set Greta becomes hysterical after noticing Schreck casts no reflection. Murnau, Albin and Fritz drug her with Murnau's laudanum, and film as Schreck feeds on Greta, with the laudanum in her blood putting Schreck to sleep. At dawn, the three attempt to open a door and let in sunlight to destroy Schreck, but discover that the vampire had previously cut the chain to the mechanism, trapping them in the process. Fritz and Albin attack Schreck, only to be killed. Murnau, meanwhile, resumes filming, and, crazed, completely ignores the deaths of his colleagues and the malicious glare Schreck is giving him. Instead, he instructs Schreck to return to his mark for another take. Schreck is told, \"If it's not in frame, it doesn't exist\". Schreck returns to feed on Greta, as Murnau films. Galeen and the crew arrive and lift the door, destroying Schreck with the sunlight. Having not noticed that he had already run out of film, he stops the camera, calmly stating, \"I think we have it.\"", "title": "Shadow of the Vampire", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q1324090"}}
{"id": "tt0708765", "text": "The USS Enterprise docks at Starbase 133, where Dr. Beverly Crusher (McFadden) greets her elderly friend and mentor, Dr. Dalen Quaice (Bill Erwin).  After taking him to his quarters, discussing the loss of old friends, Dr. Crusher visits her son Ensign Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton) in Engineering.  Wesley attempts to create a static warp bubble, but the experiment appears to fail.  As the Enterprise leaves Starbase, Dr. Crusher finds that Dr. Quaice is missing, with no record of him coming aboard the ship.  As she performs a medical test on transporter chief O'Brien (Colm Meaney), she realizes that her medical staff is missing; further investigation and discussion with the crew show that she has always worked alone in sick bay.\nDr. Crusher continues to try to track down the disappearing people and finds more and more crew members that she remembers being completely unknown to the crew or the computer.  At one point, a vortex appears near Dr. Crusher and attempts to pull her in, but she is able to hold on to a fixture until it dissipates; the ship shows no record of the vortex's appearance when she investigates.  Eventually, no one but Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) and herself remain on the ship, but Picard believes that the situation is normal.  Dr. Crusher orders the computer to give Picard's vital signs over the ship's speakers so she knows he is still there, but shortly thereafter, even he disappears.  Then, the vortex reappears, and once again tries to claim Beverly.  She is blown across the bridge, but she manages to hang onto Commander Data's (Brent Spiner) chair until the vortex disappears.\nAt this point, the viewer is shown the actual Enterprise, where Wesley had successfully created the warp bubble, accidentally trapping his mother within it. With the warp bubble collapsing rapidly, Wesley's fears lead the Traveler (Eric Menyuk) to appear and help Wesley attempt to stabilize the bubble. The Traveler recommends the Enterprise return to the Starbase, where the warp bubble was formed and may be more stable.\nWithin the warp bubble, Dr. Crusher attempts to direct the Enterprise to the home planet of the Traveler, but soon finds the ship is unable to set that destination, as it no longer exists. More of the universe she knows disappears, soon leaving only the Enterprise. She recognizes the shape as being that of Wesley's warp bubbles, and determines that she is trapped, the earlier vortex being the Enterprise crew's first attempt to save her. As the warp bubble shrinks, erasing parts of the Enterprise, she races for Engineering, the center of the warp bubble, and finds a vortex waiting there. She jumps in at the last moment, finding herself back in Engineering along with Picard, Wesley, Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton), and the Traveler. She embraces her son and obtains confirmation from Picard that the Enterprise's population (1,014 at the time, including her guest Dr. Quaice) is the correct number.\nThis episode borrows heavily from the last few chapters of Alfred Bester's classic novel The Demolished Man", "title": "Remember Me (Star Trek: The Next Generation)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q7311668"}}

The hotel desk clerk, Pete Wirth, claims he has no vacant rooms. Hector David threatens him. Later, Reno Smith informs Macreedy that Komoko, a Japanese-American, was interned during World War II.\nCertain that something is wrong, Macreedy sees the local sheriff, Tim Horn, but the alcoholic lawman is no help. The veterinarian and undertaker, Doc Velie, advises Macreedy to leave town immediately, but lets slip that Komoko is dead. Pete's sister Liz rents Macreedy a Jeep.

Doc Velie admits that something terrible happened four years ago and that Smith has everyone too terrified to speak up. Velie offers Macreedy his hearse to leave town, but Hector disables it.

Macreedy finally reveals why he is there: Komoko's son died in combat (with the 442nd Infantry Regiment) while saving his life. Macreedy intended to give the man's medal to Komoko.\nMacreedy learns that the elder Komoko had leased some farmland from Smith, who was sure there was no water there.

Jackie is pleased when Linnet agrees, but Linnet and Simon soon start a whirlwind affair and marry. While honeymooning in Egypt, they are continually hounded by the jilted Jackie. In an attempt to get away, the Doyles pretend to go to the Cairo railway station before backtracking to board a Nile paddle steamer, the S.S. Karnak.\nDuring an on-shore excursion to the nearby Temple of Karnak, a large stone is pushed off a pillar and narrowly misses the Doyles. They are shocked when Jackie joins the cruise, ignoring detective Hercule Poirot's warning to stay away. She also reveals that she carries a small automatic pistol in her handbag and is a crack shot. That night, Jackie confronts Simon in a drunken rage and shoots him in the leg. The next morning, Linnet is found dead from a gunshot wound to the head. A \"J\" written in blood on the wall above her bed implicates Jackie, but she has a solid alibi as Miss Bowers sedated her with morphia and stayed with her all night.\nPoirot and his friend, Colonel Race, investigate. They discover that numerous passengers had motives to kill Linnet: Louise Bourget, Linnet's maid, was bitter due to her mistress' refusal to grant her a promised dowry; Andrew Pennington, Linnet's American trustee, was anxious to prevent her from discovering that he embezzled from her; Mrs. van Schuyler, an elderly American socialite suffering from kleptomania, displayed a great interest in Linnet's pearl necklace; van Schuyler's nurse, Miss Bowers, blamed Linnet's father for financially ruining her own father; Salome Otterbourne, a romance novelist, was being sued for libel for a similarity between Linnet and one of her characters; Mrs. Otterbourne's daughter, Rosalie, was anxious to protect her mother from financial ruin; Jim Ferguson, an outspoken Communist, resented Linnet's wealth; and Dr. Ludwig Bessner, a Swiss psychiatrist, faced exposure by Linnet concerning his unorthodox methods affecting Linnet's past friends.\nSoon after, the crew pulls a small bundle from the Nile. The missing pistol is wrapped in Mrs. van Schuyler's stole, which has a small bullet hole. There is also a blood-stained handkerchief, and a marble ashtray used as a weight. When Linnet's pearls are missing, Mrs. van Schuyler denies taking them. Soon after, the necklace is found on Linnet's body, so Poirot deduces Mrs van Schuyler has \"returned\" them.\nWhile Poirot and Race conduct their investigation, Louise Bourget is found dead, her throat cut with one of Dr. Bessner's scalpels, and a fragment of a banknote clutched in her hand. Poirot deduces she saw the murderer coming out of Linnet's cabin and extorted money for her silence. Salome Otterbourne claims to have seen Louise's murderer and is about to tell Poirot and Race when she is shot in the head through an open cabin door with Pennington's revolver, too large to have been used on Linnet.\nPoirot gathers everyone in the saloon and reveals that Simon is responsible for Linnet's murder, with Jackie as his accomplice. She pretended to shoot Simon, drawing attention to herself. After running to Linnet's cabin and shooting her in the head, Simon shot himself in the leg, using Mrs. van Schuyler's stole as a silencer, then replaced the empty cartridges with a new one should the gun be found. He then wrapped the gun in the stole, along with a marble ashtray and the supposed blood-stained handkerchief, and threw the items out the open window, into the Nile. Jackie later killed Louise, who was blackmailing Simon because she witnessed him enter Linnet's cabin, then killed Mrs. Otterbourne, who saw Jackie exiting Louise's cabin. The plan was that Simon would marry and then kill Linnet, inherit her money, and at a later date, marry his old love.\nWhen Simon claims Poirot has no proof, Poirot reveals that the police will do a gunshot residue test known as a \"moulage\" test on both him and Jacqueline.

Three weeks into the crisis, it has been reported that millions of people have died and reanimated; despite the government's best efforts, social order is collapsing. Rural communities and the National Guard have been effective in fighting the zombie hordes in open country, but urban centers are helplessly overrun.\nAt WGON TV, a television studio in Philadelphia, traffic reporter Stephen Andrews and his pregnant girlfriend, producer Fran Parker, are planning to steal the station's helicopter to escape the city. Across town, police SWAT officer Roger DeMarco and his team raid a low-income housing project, where the mostly black and Latino tenants are defying the martial law of delivering their dead to the National Guard. The raid quickly descends into chaos when armed residents engage in a shootout with the officers. Roger attempts to restrain Wooley, a brutal and racist trooper, after he maniacally kills several unarmed civilians; Wooley is shot dead by an officer from another unit, Peter Washington. As the SWAT team dispatch the reanimated dead that have injured or killed several tenants, Roger forms an alliance with Peter, suggesting that they desert and join up with Stephen, who is his friend. They are informed by an elderly priest about a group of zombies in the basement, which they assist in the grim job of eliminating.\nLater that night, Roger and Peter rendezvous with Fran and Stephen at a police dock and then leave Philadelphia in the helicopter. Following some close calls while stopping for fuel, the group comes across a shopping mall, which they make their sanctuary. They devise an operation to block the mall entrances with trucks to keep the undead from penetrating. Peter and Stephen also cover the access to the stairwell. During the operation, Roger survives a particularly dangerous encounter, and becomes reckless as a result. He is soon bitten by the zombies.\nAfter clearing the mall's interior of zombies, the four enjoy a hedonistic lifestyle with all the goods available to them, furnishing their makeshift apartment with the mall's many commodities. Roger eventually succumbs to his wounds and dies; he is shot by Peter upon reanimating. Sometime later, all emergency broadcast transmissions cease, suggesting that the government has collapsed and a large portion of the population has become zombies. Fran, now showing her pregnancy, presses to leave the mall. Supplies are loaded into the helicopter, and Stephen gives her flying lessons.\nHaving seen the helicopter, a nomadic biker gang arrive to conquer the mall, destroying the barriers and allowing hundreds of zombies back inside. The looting bikers enrage Stephen, and he triggers a gun battle with them. Stephen is shot before being bitten by the undead. As some of the bikers are eaten by zombies, the rest retreat with their stolen goods. Stephen, now reanimated, acts on a remnant of his memories and tears down the wall covering the stairwell and leads the undead to Fran and Peter. Peter kills Stephen while Francine escapes to the roof. Peter locks himself in a room and contemplates suicide, but when the zombies burst in, he has a change of heart and fights his way up to the roof, where he joins Francine.

No one knows where they are or how they got there. Quentin informs the group that some rooms contain traps, which he discovered while exploring. Rennes, a convict who has escaped seven prisons, assumes each trap is triggered by a motion detector and tests each room by throwing one of his boots in first. The maze is beset by frequent tremors, and Leaven notices numbers inscribed in the narrow passageways between rooms. Rennes enters a room that he assumes to be safe and is killed when he is sprayed with acid, indicating that each trap is triggered by different sensors.\nQuentin believes each person was chosen to be there: He is a divorced police officer, Leaven is a young mathematics student, and Holloway is a free clinic doctor, while the surly Worth says he is only an office worker. Leaven hypothesizes that any room marked with a prime number is a trap, and they find a mentally challenged man named Kazan, whom Holloway insists they bring along. Quentin injures his leg in a trapped room deemed safe by Leaven's calculations, and tensions rise over personal conflicts and the mystery over the maze's purpose. After being provoked by Quentin, Worth finally admits that he designed the maze's outer shell\u2014in the shape of a gigantic cube\u2014for a shadowy bureaucracy, and guesses that its original purpose has been forgotten; they have been imprisoned within the maze simply to put it to use, otherwise it would only serve to be \"pointless\".\nWorth's knowledge of the outer shell's dimensions allows Leaven to determine that each side of the Cube is 26 rooms across and that there are 17,576 rooms in total. She then guesses that the numbers indicate the Cartesian coordinates of each room. The group moves toward the nearest edge as determined by her theory, but each of the rooms near the outer wall is trapped. Rather than backtrack, they travel silently through a room with a sound-activated trap. After Kazan makes a sound and nearly causes Quentin's death, Quentin threatens Kazan and clashes with Holloway, who defends Kazan and insinuates that Quentin may have been an abusive husband and likes young girls. When they reach the edge, Holloway scouts the darkened gap between the Cube and its outer shell but slips during another violent tremor; Quentin lets her fall to her death.\nQuentin becomes mentally unhinged; he attempts to persuade Leaven to join him in abandoning the others and makes a sexual advance, but she rejects him. Worth intervenes, but Quentin beats him savagely and drops him into another room through a floor hatch. There, the group finds Rennes' corpse and are demoralized by the thought of having wandered in circles. Worth then realizes that the rooms move periodically throughout the Cube, which is the cause of all the tremors. Leaven also deduces that traps are not tagged by prime numbers, but by powers of prime numbers, and Kazan reveals himself to be an autistic savant who can quickly do prime factorizations mentally. With his help, Leaven guides the group to the bridge room that will lead them out of the maze. Worth ambushes and seemingly kills Quentin before leaving him behind.

Prior to Christmas, Chris' employer, company CEO KC (Stephen Root), asks him to accompany an emerging self-obsessed pop singer named Samantha James (Anna Faris) to Paris to ensure she signs with their label, an order to which Chris reluctantly complies. She wants a relationship with Chris while he has no interest in her after their only date previously led to him being hospitalized. During the trip to Paris, Samantha accidentally sets her private jet on fire resulting in an emergency landing in New Jersey, near Chris' hometown.\nChris takes Samantha to his mother's house to spend the night and re-engages with his teenage past, including his unresolved feelings for Jamie.

At the local bar, Chris encounters some old classmates, including his other best friend Clark (Fred Ewanuick) and his wife Darla (Amy Matysio). He also encounters Jamie, who is working as a bartender to support herself through graduate school to become a teacher. Chris plans to impress and seduce Jamie by having Mike keep Samantha busy during his date with Jamie, but the realization that Jamie's platonic friendship is important to him hampers Chris' plan. During a friendly ice skating \"day date\", Chris is taken away in an ambulance after injuring himself during a hockey game with Jamie and a trio of kids (who start to share a dislike on him for his inexperience). At the scene, Jamie is reunited with Dusty Dinkleman (Chris Klein), a paramedic and former high school classmate who was also in love with her, while Chris is taunted by all of the kids in town for making them lose the game.\nThe next night, Chris goes to Jamie's for a Christmas party, planning to reveal his feelings for her, but he finds Dusty already there charming the guests with his music.

In a rage, she drives to Jamie's house and crashes through her fence, destroying her family's Christmas decorations. Chris returns home in embarrassment, and Jamie follows him. She tells him she is not mad and they end up spending the night together catching up and looking at photos. However, due to Chris' continuing lack of assertion, the two end up just sleeping and nothing happens that night.\nThe next day, Jamie speaks with Darla about the night before, while Chris goes to Clark's dental office for advice, her fear that Chris' lack of affection means that he does not like her. Jamie admits that while the two are \"just friends\", she tried to show Chris that she is interested in a relationship. Clark tells Chris that \"the timing wasn't right\" and Jamie and Chris' history hinders his willingness to have sex with her. Outside the office, they happen to catch Dusty singing to a nurse and then kissing her. Dusty reveals to Chris and Clark that he only plans to have sex with Jamie, as he wants to humiliate her in the same way that he felt she used to humiliate him when he was a nerd and she was the object of his affections.\nChris tries to warn Jamie, but instead ends up attacking Dusty in front of her.

Nick and Elizabeth then encounter drunken priest Father Malone, who is ranting about murderers and retribution. Meanwhile, at the local radio station, host Stevie Wayne gets a phone call from weatherman Dan about a large fog bank off the coast. Out at sea on Nick's boat, Spooner and Nick's cousin Sean are partying with two young women, Mandi and Jennifer. As the fog reaches them, the boat's engine stops, and the instruments break. An old clipper ship appears in the fog next to them. Seemingly possessed, Jennifer draws a set of scales on a misted window inside the boat. Unseen forces then kill Mandi, Jennifer, and Sean. At Nick's beach house, Elizabeth has been dreaming about the Elizabeth Dane. She searches the Internet for information about the hallmark symbol she saw earlier, but her computer malfunctions, and the word \"Dane\" appears on the screen. She hears a knock at the front door, goes outside but finds nothing. As she walks down to the beach, the fog begins approaching, but Nick brings her back inside.\nThe next day, Nick's Uncle Hank telephones him about the disappearance of his boat. Nick and Elizabeth sail out and find the vessel and the three corpses. Elizabeth goes into the hold and finds Spooner alive in a freezer. They return to the island where Mayor Tom Malone - father Malone's father - suspects Spooner of the murders. In the morgue, Sean's corpse briefly rises up and accosts Elizabeth. At the library, Elizabeth researches the scales symbol seen on the watch's hallmark. It represented an old trading colony north of Antonio Island, which generated substantial wealth through intercontinental trade but was abandoned due to a leprosy outbreak. At the docks, Elizabeth finds the buried journal of Patrick Malone from 1871. She and Nick learn the story of the Elizabeth Dane and realize the founders built the town with the fortune they had stolen from the ship, but kept this secret from their families and the townsfolk.\nThe ghosts of the Elizabeth Dane seek revenge against Antonio Island's residents for the past crimes of its founding fathers. After killing Dan at the weather station, they pursue Stevie's son Andy and his Aunt Connie at home. Connie is killed, but Nick and Elizabeth rescue Andy. In her car, Stevie is also attacked, but she escapes. They travel to the Town Hall where the founders' murderous secrets are exposed. The spirits kill Hank Castle, Kathy Williams and the Malones. The ghost of Blake then seeks Elizabeth. Despite being a descendant of David Williams, Elizabeth is the reincarnation of Blake's wife and was one of her ancestor's victims, hence her mysterious dreams about the Elizabeth Dane. Blake kisses Elizabeth, she transforms into a spirit and disappears as Nick watches helplessly. The next day, the survivors try to cope with their traumatic experiences and the truth about their ancestors. As Stevie reflects on the night's events with her listeners, Nick throws Patrick Malone's journal into the sea.", "title": "The Fog (2005 film)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q1697426"}}

warrior.\nHis many victories come from the help of a sorcerer who predicts the outcomes of battles, leaving only a few free tribes to oppose him.\nMathayus, his half-brother Jesup, and friend Rama, the only three true remaining Akkadians, are hired by King Pheron of the last free tribes to kill Memnon's sorcerer for twenty blood rubies, upsetting Pheron's son Takmet, as it is the last of their treasury, and Nubian King Balthazar, who dislikes the Akkadians.\nThe Akkadians manage to sneak into Memnon's camp, but are ambushed by Memnon's guards, having been tipped off by Takmet who killed his own father and defected to Memnon's side.\nJesup and Rama are hit by arrows, but Mathayus manages to sneak into the sorcerer's tent, where he sees that the sorcerer is actually a sorceress, Cassandra.\nMathayus is ambushed and meets Memnon himself, who brutally executes Jesup in front of him, and is about to kill Mathayus too.\nCassandra, however, tells Memnon that the gods wish Mathayus to survive the night, and to defy them will incur their wrath and cost him his victories.\nMemnon has Mathayus buried to his neck in the desert to be devoured by fire ants at dawn, but he manages to escape with help from a horse thief, Arpid.\nDeciding to finish his mission and avenge his brother, Mathayus sneaks into Memnon's stronghold, Gomorrah, and manages to enter Memnon's palace with help from a street urchin.\nHe briefly meets Memnon's court magician, Philos, who hides him and then directs him to the courtyard where Memnon is training.\nMathayus tries to shoot Memnon from the watchtower, but is forced to save the street urchin from having his hand amputated for theft by shooting the axe out of Takmet's hand, alerting the guards to his presence.\nMathayus only barely

abdomen.\nWith his dying breaths, Thorak manages to stab Mathayus in the leg with a scorpion blood-laced arrow.\nCassandra, however, uses her magic to save Mathayus' life.\nAs an insult and a warning, Mathayus sends Thorak's blood-stained pendant to Memnon.\nMathayus, Arpid and Cassandra then run into Philos, who had earlier managed to flee from Memnon's palace and has perfected an explosive powder he was working on.\nHowever, they are ambushed by the rebels, now under the rule of Balthazar.\nThough Mathayus defeats Balthazar in a fight and earns his grudging respect and sanctuary, Cassandra has a vision of Memnon and his army slaughtering the entire rebel camp.\nShe informs Mathayus and then prophesies that when the moonlight reaches Memnon's palace, the King on High will become the invincible Scorpion King, and Memnon believes himself to be the one destined to become the Scorpion King.\nFurthermore, she informs Mathayus that if he faces Memnon, he will most likely die from being shot, but Mathayus assures her that he will make his own destiny and they sleep together.\nThe next morning, however, Cassandra returns to Memnon in order to stall him and possibly kill

After ignoring requests from both clans to join them, he is given shelter by a woman named Ruriko, who takes care of her mute grandson Heihachi. Ruriko tells the gunman that many years ago, the town prospered in gold mining until both clans fought over the gold and drove away the population. The Heike-aligned sheriff tells the gunman that in the midst of the chaos, a Heike man named Akira married a Genji woman named Shizuka and lived peacefully with their son Heihachi, until Heike leader Kiyomori killed Akira in cold blood, rendering Heihachi mute from the trauma. Seeking protection for her son, Shizuka became a prostitute for the Genji. Since then, Heihachi has been tending to a trio of red and white roses, waiting for the day they bloom.\nLater that day, the gunman wins a challenge from the Genji henchman Yoichi to have Shizuka for the night. Before he proceeds with her, he is told by Genji leader Yoshitsune that he is reminiscent of the legendary female gunslinger Bloody Benten. Later, Shizuka warns the gunman that Yoshitsune sent some men to retrieve a new weapon for Yoichi to use on him. He tells Shizuka to take her son and leave town tomorrow. The next morning, following a tip-off from Shizuka, the sheriff informs Kiyomori of the Genjis' plans. The Heikes ambush the wagon, with Kiyomori acquiring a Gatling gun stored inside a coffin. Meanwhile, as the Genjis race toward the wagon raid, Ruriko, Shizuka and Heihachi are fleeing from town when Shizuka runs back to save the roses. She is mortally shot through the heart by Yoichi. The gunman attempts to intervene, but is forced to drop his guns before being tortured by the Genji thug. Ruriko's servant Toshio suddenly appears and throws a gun at her before she shoots and kills Yoichi and his henchmen, revealing herself to be Bloody Benten. In retaliation for the wagon raid, the Genjis destroy the Heikes' fortress.\nWhile the native doctor Piripero tends to the gunman's wounds, Ruriko has Toshio retrieve some guns from the elderly Piringo, who reveals to him that he trained her to be a gunman and Akira was their son. Ruriko plans to settle the score with the Genjis once and for all by luring them with a chest loaded with gold nuggets in the middle of town. The Genjis are killed by the gunman and Ruriko while the surviving Heikes make their way back to town. Ruriko kills the Heikes and Kiyomori, avenging her son's death, but is fatally shot by the sheriff, who in turn is shot down by a mortally wounded Toshio and impaled with a tombstone cross by Piripero.

{"id": "tt0052151", "text": "A World War II US Navy submarine officer, Commander P.J. Richardson (Clark Gable), is determined to get revenge on the Japanese destroyer Akikaze and its ace captain, nicknamed \"Bungo Pete\", who has sunk four US submarines in the Bungo Straits, including his previous command. He persuades the Navy Board to give him a new submarine command with the provision that his executive officer be someone who has just returned from active sea patrol. He single-mindedly trains the crew of his new boat, the USS Nerka, to return to the Bungo Straits and sink Bungo Pete, in spite of the Navy's expressly forbidding him from approaching the Bungo Straits on this mission. Richardson's executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Jim Bledsoe (Burt Lancaster), is worried about the safety of his boat and his crew. He also resents Richardson and the Navy leadership for denying him command of the Nerka, which he believes should have been his.\nRichardson begins to rigorously drill the crew on a rapid bow shot: Firing at the bow of an approaching ship, considered an act of desperation due to a vessel's extremely narrow profile. He then bypasses one target, only to take on a Japanese destroyer with a bow shot. The crew is outraged as it discovers that Richardson is avoiding legitimate targets in order to enter the Bungo Straits undetected in direct violation of his mission orders.\nFinally, they come upon a large convoy. Soon after blowing up a cargo ship and then engaging Bungo Pete, they are attacked by aircraft that had been alerted to their presence and were waiting in ambush. They are forced to dive and barely survive depth charges. Three of the crew are killed, and Richardson suffers an incapacitating concussion. The submarine also narrowly dodges what the crew mistakenly believes is one of their own torpedoes doubling back on them. By sending up blankets, equipment, and the bodies of the dead, they convince the Japanese that the submarine has been sunk. Bledsoe uses Richardson's injury to assume command and set course for Pearl Harbor.\nWhile listening to Tokyo Rose proclaiming the sinking of their boat, several crewmen are mystified about how the Japanese are able to identify several of them by name. Bledsoe realizes that the Japanese have analyzed their floating trash, so he decides to turn that to his advantage. Since the Japanese believe the Nerka has been sunk, he returns to the Bungo Straits to fight the Akikaze, which the submarine sinks with a bow shot, only to be attacked again by a mystery torpedo. Richardson deduces that the Akikaze was not working alone to sink US submarines, but was in concert with a Japanese submarine. He orders the boat into a dive just seconds before a Japanese torpedo races by.\nAfter a brief underwater standoff, Bledsoe realizes that, with the Akikaze gone, the Japanese sub must defend its convoy; by attacking the convey, the Nerka forces its adversary to surface, and destroys it by firing torpedoes under a shallow-draft ship.

An officer inside the bank tries to call for help on his police radio. Detective Tom Iger, who had just been in the bank, hears the call and decides to check it out. While walking back to check on the bank, he hears another anonymous call on his radio about the robbery.\nThe robbers find only $70,000 in the vault. Leah wants to leave, but Vee and Cyrus demand more money. The assistant manager Ed Maas says he will tell them where $6 million is stored as long as they do not hurt anyone. He tells them the money is in the basement vault which is a part of the old bank and hands them the key to the access door. \nBy now, police are stationed outside the bank and Leah is confused as to how they knew about the heist. The head teller, Susan, tries to connect with Michael, telling him he is a decent man. He tells her that he owes people a lot of money and his sisters are helping him rob the bank. \nWhen Kramer successfully breaks open the vault, the lights flicker. A man in a white mask and what appears to be a group of the hostages attack him. He is pulled inside the old vault. Leah and Vee watch from the security monitors upstairs, but only Kramer appears on the screen. Thinking there are more people in the bank, Leah asks Cyrus to count the hostages that are gathered inside the safety deposit vault. The lights start to flicker again and the vault door closes with Cyrus and the hostages inside. As Kramer is repeatedly stabbed in the basement vault, Cyrus is overcome by the same group of hostages that attacked Kramer. The man in the white mask appears and grabs his gun, forcing it into Cyrus's mouth. When the vault door opens again, Leah goes in but Cyrus is nowhere in sight. Michael sees Kramer commit suicide.\nSuspecting that Susan called the police, Leah interrogates her. Susan tells Leah about the robbery in 1982 where a robber in a white mask apparently \"snapped\" under the pressure and killed some hostages, forced some to kill each other and burned the rest alive in the old vault. The masked man was never caught or found. Vee turns up with a bag of money\u2014but the bills are all from 1982.\nAfter the police attempt to take Leah and Vee out with sniper fire, an outgoing call indicator on an office telephone catches Leah's attention. She picks it up and listens to the same robbery message that Detective Iger had heard earlier. Michael cuts into a water pipe to make an escape route and encounters a burned woman pleading for help. Vee finds Cyrus's body with his head blown off. Leah heads outside and releases one of the hostages. She asks Iger who made the phone call to the police, about the message. He answers that it came from the radio, not the phone. Leah goes back inside to the telephone and listens as the same message repeats, suddenly recognizing the voice.\nVee escapes through the water pipe. As Michael begins setting the place on fire to cover their escape, Leah lets the hostages go. As she attempts to escape through the water pipe, the masked man and un-dead hostages attack her. Michael distracts them long enough to allow Leah to escape before setting the bank on fire, sacrificing himself.\nDuring the ensuing police interview of the hostages, Iger tries to find out why they know nothing about Maas. Susan says she's known all the employees inside the bank for ten years and has never seen the man before. Susan looks at the investigation wall and points to a picture of Maas. Iger tells her the picture is of someone who died in the 1982 incident. He was the assistant manager who had called the police to report the robbery but was shot by the robber. It was the same call Leah and Iger had heard the previous day.\nLeah and Vee meet in a rural area. The police assume all of the robbers died in the fire, so they are free to start their lives anew.

{"id": "tt1735485", "text": "The film is framed as a documentary, occasionally cutting away to interviews with Natasha and Steven recorded after the events.\nIn the midst of the drought and water shortages, the New South Wales State government has unveiled plans to recycle millions of liters of water trapped in a network of abandoned train tunnels beneath the heart of Sydney. However, the government suddenly goes cold on the plan, and it does not tell the public why. There is also talk of homeless people who use the tunnel as shelter going missing. This and the silence from the ministers leads a journalist, Natasha, to begin an investigation into a government cover-up. She and her crew Peter (producer), Steven (camera operator), and Tangles (audio engineer) decide to investigate the story and plan to enter the tunnels themselves. After being refused entry by a security guard, they find an alternate entry and make their way inside. They proceed to explore the tunnels and locate various abandoned homeless squats and sections used as air raid shelters in the 1940s.\nThey come upon a huge underground lake; and, while filming, Tangles hears strange noises through the audio headphones. Later, the group heads to the room where the WWII air raid bell is. To get footage of the bell's ringing, Natasha hits it; but Tangles says the sound's loudness is distorting the audio recording. He decides to take the boom-mike into an adjoining room to reduce the sound levels, leaving Peter with the headphones to listen for distortion in the bell volume. Natasha hits it again, and Peter hears something very disturbing in the headphones. Tangles' audio cable is suddenly pulled through the opening, snapping and disappearing. The rest of the crew panics and goes to look for Tangles.\nThe scene switches to the interview, where Natasha is allowed to hear this recording for the first time. As the sound of the bell plays, screams of agony can be clearly heard before the headphone wire snaps. Upon going back to the bell room minutes after they left, the crew finds that all their equipment has disappeared. While searching for Tangles, they find a room blocked off by corrugated metal. Natasha puts down her night-vision camera to help Peter and Steve. They get into the room and are horrified to find large amounts of still dripping blood, as well as Tangles' abandoned torch. At the entrance of the room, Natasha picks up the camera, noticing that it is not where she had left it. Reviewing the footage, it is revealed that something picked up the camera and is stalking them.\nThe crew ventures through the tunnel, trying to find a way out. They hear a person call down to them, and they come upon the security guard who had earlier refused them entry. The group tell him that one of their crew has gone missing, but the guard instead tells them to quickly follow him and get out, ignoring their pleas to help them find Tangles. Something pounces on the guard as he nears a corner, dragging him out of sight into another tunnel with incredible speed. The group flees, screaming in terror through the narrow tunnels. They hide in a room and stay there until they believe whatever the thing that grabbed the security guard has left the immediate surroundings. In an attempt to find a way out, they soon return to the underground lake. Hearing something nearby, they extinguish all light and use the night-vision camera to look toward the sound. There, they discover the security guard, his eyes missing, whimpering in pain in the shallows of the lake. The crew watches in horror as a tall, emaciated humanoid appears behind him and brutally murders him, slowly twisting his head until his neck breaks. Natasha lets out a scream, attracting the creature's attention; and the terrified group runs with the creature almost immediately giving chase after them.\nThey come to a dead-end with a barred opening into a street above them (which Natasha screams up into for help), but when that fails, the group continues searching for an exit. At one point, the creature attempts to grab Peter from an opening; however, when Steven shines the camera's light on it, the creature immediately retreats. Steven realizes that the creature is vulnerable to or afraid of light. Upon reaching another dead-end, Natasha discovers a side route blocked by planks of wood. Entering this new room, they find signs of some living being, as well as a small pile of human flesh. The main camera loses power, and Steve frantically attempts to replace the battery. Just as the power switches the light on again, the creature attacks, knocking Peter and Steven to the ground. Natasha, panic-stricken, runs off with the night-vision camera. On her own, she stays in silence but is confronted by the monster, who cracks the camera lens as it grabs at her, dragging her as the small camera still records. Steven and Peter follow the sound of her screams and the monster's movements.\nThrough the night-vision camera, it is shown that Natasha was dragged back to the lake. The monster attempts to drown Natasha; but before it can succeed, Steven and Peter use the light to chase it away. As Steven helps Natasha, Peter is heard in the distance screaming and challenging the monster, drawing it away from the other two. Steven manages to drag Natasha to a well-lit tunnel near a train station. They rush back and drag a badly-wounded Peter to the safety of the train platform. There, captured on CCTV, Natasha begs for help, and uses a borrowed cell phone to call the emergency services. The crew ends up staying in the tunnel all night.\nIn the epilogue, it is stated that the coroner found that Peter eventually died from extensive internal bleeding. Natasha resigned after the underground shoot, no longer working as a journalist. Steven still works as a news cameraman. Tangles' whereabouts remain unknown, and his family is still searching for answers.

only Shephard has the presence of mind to remove his mask and reveal his humanity and somewhat familiar face to the terrified caveman, permitting the caveman to settle back into a more peaceful sleep and make a full recovery.\nThe scientists place the caveman in an artificial, simulated environment for study.\nThe caveman quickly discovers the modern apparatus and environmental controls, and understands he is still far from home.\nShephard believes that the caveman's culture may provide clues to learning about the human body's adaptability, citing ceremonies such as firewalking and the Sun Dance.\nSeveral other scientists in the research base see the potential in studying the caveman's DNA and his survival in the ice, as they see it mainly as a case to advance medical science by \"freezing\" the sick or injured in order to suspend their bodies until treatment.\nShephard's affinity with the caveman grows to the degree that he begins to defend the caveman's right to be considered a human being and not a scientific specimen.\nDespite opposition from the rest of the staff, Shephard initiates an encounter with the caveman.\nShephard names him \"Charlie\" after the iceman introduces himself as \"Char-u\".\nShephard and Charlie bond, but it becomes obvious to the anthropologist that Charlie misses his world; he is terrified and confused by the unknown world in which he awakens.\nAn eminent linguist is brought to the Arctic base to help understand Charlie's language.\nAs Shephard begins to communicate with Charlie, he realizes that he will never be able to help Charlie understand that the world and community he came from have long since disappeared.\nThis fact is made even more poignant when Shephard introduces Charlie to a female colleague, dr Diane Brady (Lindsay Crouse).\nAssuming that the woman is Shephard's mate, Charlie makes chalk marks which indicate that he likely was a married man with children before he was frozen.\nShephard strives to understand what motivates Charlie and why, of all the cavemen, he should survive being frozen.\nAt one point, Shephard begins to sing \"Heart of Gold\", inspiring Charlie to sing one of his own songs.\nCharlie's seemingly incidental bird-like line drawings in the ground resembling body markings on his chest take on a new significance when the base's helicopter strays over the roof of the base's artificial tropical eco-zone, causing Charlie to take on an almost obsessive zeal as he climbs towards the roof.\nShouting the word Beedha over and over, he lifts his arms towards the helicopter in a sign of obvious worship.\nEven though the helicopter pulls away from the dome, Shephard knows that Charlie can now think of nothing else.\nCharlie escapes after watching Shephard exit the biosphere and in a panic of seeing unfamiliar modern devices and believing there are enemies, spears Maynard (James Tolkan), one of the base's technicians.\nRecapturing Charlie, the other scientists, led by dr Singe (David Strathairn), focus on what they can learn from him, using him as a subject rather than a person.\nThey attempt to re-freeze the iceman in order to study the effect of thawing on Charlie's physiology and determine what benefit may result.\nThe incident goes awry as Charlie nearly dies in the attempt.\nShephard consults local Inuit who recognize the name that Charlie chanted and explain that it is a mythical bird &ndash; a messenger from the gods who comes to take good people to heaven, while sinners are sent to a kind of purgatory.\nShephard has long known that Charlie has a spiritual dimension and now sees that he was on a dreamwalk pilgrimage, a mythical quest for redemption.\nHis people were dying in the sudden ice age; he must have offered himself to the gods in the form of a self-sacrifice or appealing to the gods to redeem his tribe.\nShephard defies all protocol to help Charlie to escape, because he realizes that Charlie would never survive in the modern world, and Charlie's peace-of-mind and fulfillment are of prime importance to Shephard.\nDelighted with his freedom, Charlie races on ahead of Shephard as they pass by glaciers and vast ice-shelves, and a crevasse opens up in front of Shephard, cutting him off from Charlie.\nMeanwhile, the other personnel give chase.\nThe helicopter emerges over an ice-shelf before Charlie.\nShephard looks on helplessly as Charlie climbs up towards the aircraft and grabs hold of one of its landing skis.\nIn an attempt to evade Charlie's grasp, the helicopter pilot pulls up, but Charlie dangles beneath the aircraft while it continues to climb high into the sky.\nThe co-pilot offers a hand to Charlie to save him, but an elated and ecstatic Charlie cries out and releases the aircraft, seeming to float through the sky while he plunges.\nShephard's initial horror turns into joy as he realizes that Charlie has reached his goal.", "title": "Iceman (1984 film)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q1754652"}}

Unbeknownst to them, Tony knows about the affair, and is planning to have Margot killed so he can inherit her fortune.\nTony invites an old acquaintance from the University of Cambridge, small-time criminal Charles Swann, to his London flat. He tells Swann about Margot's affair, and that, six months earlier, he had stolen her handbag, which contained a love letter from Mark, and anonymously blackmailed her. Tony tells Swann that he has been following him for a year, and knows that he swindled and murdered his landlady. After tricking Swann into leaving his fingerprints on the letter, Tony offers to pay him \u00a31,000 to kill Margot; if Swann refuses, Tony will turn him in to the police as Margot's blackmailer.\nAfter Swann agrees, Tony explains his plan: the following evening, he will go with Mark to a party, leaving Margot at home while hiding her latchkey under the carpet. Swann is to sneak in and, after Tony telephones the flat from the party, strangle Margot when she answers the call.\nThe following night, Swann enters the flat while Margot is in bed and waits. Tony calls the flat, and when Margot comes to the phone, Swann tries to strangle her, but she stabs Swann in the back with scissors, killing him. When Margot grabs the phone and pleads for help, Tony tells her not to call the police. After sending Margot to bed, Tony moves what he thinks is her latchkey from Swann's pocket into her handbag, and plants Mark's letter and Margot's stocking on Swann to make it look like she killed him in cold blood.\nThe following day, Tony persuades Margot to hide the fact that he told her not to call the police immediately. Chief Inspector Hubbard arrives and questions the Wendices, and Margot makes several conflicting statements. When Hubbard says Swann must have entered through the front door, Tony lies that Swann had Margot's handbag and a copy of her key. As Tony intends, Hubbard does not believe the story and arrests Margot after concluding that she killed Swann for blackmailing her. Margot is found guilty of murder and sentenced to death.\nOn the day before Margot's scheduled execution, Mark visits Tony, saying he has devised a story for him to tell the police to save Margot. Mark's \"story\" is very close to what actually happened: that Tony paid Swann to kill Margot. Hubbard arrives unexpectedly, and tricks Tony into revealing that his latchkey is in his raincoat, and inquires about Tony's attach\u00e9 case. Tony claims to have misplaced it, but Mark finds it on the bed, full of banknotes. Deducing that the money was Tony's intended payoff to Swann, Mark explains his theory to Hubbard. Tony \"confesses\" that the cash was Margot's blackmail payment to Swann, which he had concealed to protect her. Hubbard appears to accept Tony's explanation, and Mark leaves angrily. Hubbard discreetly swaps his own raincoat with Tony's. As soon as Tony leaves, Hubbard uses Tony's key to re-enter the flat, followed by Mark. Hubbard had already discovered that the key in Margot's handbag was Swann's own latchkey and deduced that Swann had put the Wendices' key back in its hiding-place after unlocking the door. Now, correctly suspecting Tony of having conspired with Swann, Hubbard had developed an elaborate ruse to trap him.\nPlainclothes police officers bring Margot from prison to the flat. She tries unsuccessfully to unlock the door with the key in her handbag, then enters through the garden, proving to Hubbard that she is unaware of the hidden key and is therefore innocent. Hubbard has Margot's handbag returned to the police station, where Tony retrieves it after discovering that he has no key. The key from Margot's bag does not work, so he uses the hidden key to open the door, demonstrating his guilt. With his escape routes blocked by Hubbard and another policeman, Tony calmly makes himself a drink and congratulates Hubbard as Hubbard calls in backup.", "title": "Dial M for Murder", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q496255"}}

Julien is an ex-Foreign Legion parachutist officer and a veteran of the Indochina and Algeria wars. After working late on a Saturday, with a rope he climbs up one story on the outside of the office building, shoots Carala in his office without being seen, arranges the room to make it look like a suicide, and then makes his way out to the street. As he gets into his Chevrolet convertible outside, he glances up and sees his rope still hanging from the building. Leaving the engine running, he rushes back and jumps into the elevator. As it ascends, the caretaker switches off the power and locks up the building for the weekend. Julien is trapped between floors.\nMoments later, Julien's car is stolen by a young couple, small-time crook Louis and flower shop assistant V\u00e9ronique. Florence, who is waiting for Julien at a caf\u00e9 nearby, sees the car go past with V\u00e9ronique leaning out of the window. She assumes that Julien has run off with her and wanders the Paris streets despondently all night asking for him in the bars and clubs where he is known. While joy-riding, Louis puts on Julien's coat and gloves. Checking into a country motel, the two register under the name \"Mr. and Mrs. Julien Tavernier\" to avoid problems for Louis, who is wanted for petty crimes. At the motel, they make the acquaintance of Horst Bencker and his wife Frieda, a jovial German couple on holiday with whom they had raced en route to the motel. After Frieda takes pictures of Louis and her husband with Julien's camera, V\u00e9ronique takes the film to the motel's photo lab for developing.\nAfter the Benckers go to bed, Louis attempts to steal their Mercedes-Benz 300 SL. Bencker catches Louis and threatens him with what appears to be a gun, though it is really a cigar tube. Louis shoots and kills the couple with Julien's handgun. He and V\u00e9ronique return to Paris and hide in her flat. Convinced that the crime will be traced to them, V\u00e9ronique persuades Louis to join her in a suicide pact. They take an overdose of pills and pass out.\nThe Benckers' bodies are discovered, along with Julien's car, handgun, and raincoat. Julien therefore becomes the prime suspect in their murders, and the morning newspapers print his picture. Searching for him, the police arrive at the office building with the caretaker, who unlocks the entrance doors and switches on the power. The elevator is working once more, and Julien is able to escape without being seen, but when he orders coffee and croissants in a caf\u00e9, he is recognized, and the police are called to arrest him. In the office building, the police discover Carala's body but assume he committed suicide. However, they charge Julien with killing the Benckers, refusing to believe his alibi of being stuck in an elevator.\nFlorence is determined to clear him and sets out to find V\u00e9ronique. She and Louis, their suicide attempt having failed, are alive but drowsy. Florence accuses them of killing the Benckers and goes to call the police. Louis at first thinks there is no evidence to connect him with the crime, but V\u00e9ronique remembers the photographs of him with Bencker. Rushing to the photo lab, Louis finds that the police have developed the pictures, and he is arrested.\nFlorence has followed him, and when she enters the lab, the police show her the photographs taken with Julien's camera.

{"id": "tt0039631", "text": "Henri Verdoux had been a bank teller for thirty years before being laid off. To support his wheelchair-bound wife and child, he turns to the business of marrying and murdering wealthy widows. The Couvais family becomes suspicious when Thelma Couvais withdraws all her money and disappears two weeks after marrying a man named \"Varnay\", whom they only know through a photograph.\nAs Verdoux (Chaplin) prepares to sell Thelma Couvais's home, the widowed Marie Grosnay (Isobel Elsom) visits. Verdoux sees her as another \"business\" opportunity and attempts to charm her, but she refuses. Over the following weeks, Verdoux has a flower girl (Barbara Slater) repeatedly send Grosnay flowers. In need of money to invest, Verdoux, as M. Floray, visits Lydia Floray (Margaret Hoffman) and convinces her he is her absent husband. She complains that his engineering job has kept him away too long. That night, Verdoux murders her for her money.\nAt a dinner party with his real wife and their friend the local chemist, Verdoux asks the chemist about the drug he developed to exterminate animals painlessly. The chemist explains the formula and that he had to stop working on it after the local pharmaceutical board banned it. Verdoux says he could test the drug by using it on a tramp off the street, then laughs it off as a morbid joke. Later at his furniture office he attempts to recreate the drug.\nShortly thereafter, Verdoux finds The Girl (Marilyn Nash) taking shelter from the rain in a doorway and takes her in. When he finds she was just released from prison and has nowhere to go, he prepares dinner for her with wine laced with his newly developed poison. Before drinking the wine, she thanks him for his kindness, and starts to talk about her husband who died while she was in jail. After she says her husband was a helpless invalid and that made her all the more devoted to him, Verdoux says he thinks there's cork in her wine and replaces it with a glass of unpoisoned wine. She leaves without knowing of his cynical intentions.\nVerdoux makes several attempts to murder Annabella Bonheur (Martha Raye), who believes Verdoux to be Bonheur, a sea captain who is frequently away, including by strangulation while boating, and by poisoned wine, but she is impervious, repeatedly escaping death without even realizing while, at the same time, putting Verdoux himself in danger or near death. Meanwhile, Grosnay eventually softens and relents from the continual flowers from Verdoux and invites him to her residence. He convinces her to marry him, and Grosnay's friends hold a large public wedding to Verdoux's disapproval. Unexpectedly, Bonheur shows up to the wedding. Panicking, Verdoux fakes a cramp to avoid being seen and eventually deserts the wedding.\nIn the years leading up to Second World War, European markets collapse, with the subsequent bank failures causing Verdoux to go bankrupt. The economic crisis leads to rise of fascism across Europe. A few years later, in 1937, with the Spanish Civil War underway, The Girl, now well-dressed and chic, once again finds Verdoux on a street corner in Paris. She invites him to an elegant dinner at a high-end restaurant as a gesture of gratitude for his actions earlier. The girl has married a wealthy munitions executive she does not love to be well-off. Verdoux reveals that he has lost his family. At the restaurant, members of the Couvais family recognize Verdoux and attempt a pursuit. Verdoux delays them long enough to bid the unnamed girl farewell before letting himself be captured by the investigators.\nVerdoux is exposed and convicted of murder. When he is sentenced in the courtroom, rather than expressing remorse he takes the opportunity to say that the world encourages mass killers, and that compared to the makers of modern weapons he is but an amateur. Later, before being led from his cell to the guillotine, a journalist asks him for a story with a moral, but he answers evasively, dismissing his killing of a few, for which he has been condemned, as not worse than the killing of many in war, for which others are honored, \"Wars, conflict - it's all business. One murder makes a villain; millions, a hero. Numbers sanctify, my good fellow!\" His last visitor before being taken to be executed is a priest (Fritz Leiber). When guards come to take him to the guillotine he is offered a cigarette, which he refuses, and a glass of rum, which he also refuses before changing his mind. He says \"I've never tasted rum\", downs the glass, and the priest begins reciting a prayer in Latin as the guards lead him away and the film ends.", "title": "Monsieur Verdoux", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q572440"}}

Wandering the streets by himself in search of someone to adopt him, the kitten meets a laid-back mongrel named Dodger, who agrees to help him steal food from a hot dog vendor. Dodger then reneges on the deal and flees with the hot dogs. \nThe kitten pursues Dodger all over New York City until he eventually arrives at a barge, where he sees Dodger share his meal with a gang of poverty-stricken dogs (Tito the chihuahua, Einstein the Great Dane, Rita the Saluki, and Francis the bulldog). The kitten accidentally falls into the barge, startling the dogs; however, while they are annoyed, none of them harm him. Fagin, the bargeman and petty thief who owns the dogs, is indebted to Sykes, a nefarious loan shark and criminal. Sykes arrives and gives Fagin an ultimatum; repay the money in three days, or suffer violence, possibly even death. Sykes' two Dobermans, Roscoe and DeSoto, harass Fagin's dogs and threaten to eat the kitten, until he scratches DeSoto's nose, earning Fagin and the dogs' respect. Roscoe warns that they will try to exact revenge.\nThe next morning, Fagin goes to pawn some of his stolen goods, while the dogs and the kitten try to steal more money for him. Through a theatrical ruse, the animals stop a limousine belonging to the wealthy Foxworth family, but the attempt to rob the limo fails, and the kitten is taken by the child Jenny Foxworth, who is missing her vacationing parents and desires a companion.

His anonymously written ransom note reaches Jenny, who sets out to get Oliver back at the pier.\nJenny and Georgette meet with Fagin, who is shocked to be dealing with a little girl whose \"ransom money\" is a piggy bank. Bothered by his conscience and Jenny's tears, Fagin gives Oliver back freely. Sykes, whom Fagin had informed of the deal beforehand, is watching from the shadows and kidnaps Jenny, intending to ransom her while declaring Fagin's debt paid.

He is driven by its captain and chief engineer to a raucous French bordello where he meets some of the crew. Thomsen, another captain, gives a crude drunken speech to celebrate his Ritterkreuz award, in which he mocks Adolf Hitler.\nThe next morning, U-96 sails out of the harbour of La Rochelle and Werner is given a tour of the boat. As time passes, he observes ideological differences between the new crew members and the hardened veterans, particularly the captain, who is embittered and cynical about the war. The new men, including Werner, are mocked by the rest of the crew, who share a tight bond. One Nazi officer is disliked by the others.  After days of boredom, the crew is excited by another U-boat's spotting of an enemy convoy, but they are soon spotted by a British destroyer, and are bombarded with depth charges. They escape with only light damage.\nThe next three weeks are spent enduring a relentless North Atlantic gale. Morale drops after a series of misfortunes, but the crew is cheered temporarily by a chance encounter with Thomsen's boat. Shortly after the storm ends, the boat encounters a British convoy and quickly launches four torpedoes, sinking two ships. They are spotted by a destroyer and have to dive below test depth, the submarine's rated limit. During the ensuing depth-charge attack, the chief machinist, Johann, panics and has to be restrained. The boat sustains heavy damage, but is eventually able to safely surface when night falls. A British tanker they torpedoed is still afloat and on fire, so they torpedo it again, only to learn there are still sailors aboard. The crew watch in horror as the sailors leap overboard and swim towards them. Unable to accommodate prisoners, the captain orders the boat away.\nThe worn-out U-boat crew looks forward to returning home to La Rochelle in time for Christmas, but the ship is ordered to La Spezia, Italy, which means passing through the Strait of Gibraltar\u2014an area heavily defended by the Royal Navy. The U-boat makes a secret night rendezvous at the harbour of Vigo, in neutral although Axis-friendly Spain, with the SS Weser, an interned German merchant ship that clandestinely provides U-boats with fuel, torpedoes, and other supplies. The filthy officers seem out of place at the opulent dinner prepared for them, but are warmly greeted by enthusiastic officers eager to hear their exploits. The captain learns from an envoy of the German consulate that his request for Werner and the Chief Engineer to be sent back to Germany has been denied.\nThe crew finishes resupplying and departs for Italy. As they carefully approach the Strait of Gibraltar and are just about to dive, they are suddenly attacked and heavily damaged by a British fighter plane, wounding the navigator, Kriechbaum. The captain orders the boat directly south towards the North African coast at full speed determined to save his crew even if he loses the boat. British warships begin shelling and they are forced to dive. When attempting to level off, the boat does not respond and continues to sink until, just before being crushed by the pressure, it lands on a sea shelf, at the depth of 280 metres. The crew works desperately to make numerous repairs before running out of oxygen. After over 16 hours, they are able to surface by blowing their ballast tanks, and limp back towards La Rochelle under cover of darkness.\nThe crew is exhausted when they finally reach La Rochelle on Christmas Eve. Shortly after Kriechbaum is taken ashore to a waiting ambulance, Allied planes bomb and strafe the facilities, wounding or killing many of the crew. Ullmann, Johann, the 2nd Watch Officer, and the Bibelforscher are killed. Frenssen, Bootsmann Lamprecht, and Hinrich are wounded. After the raid, Werner leaves the U-boat bunker in which he had taken shelter and finds the captain, badly injured by shrapnel, watching his U-boat sink in the dock.

They are starting middle school in two days, warned by Luke's older sister Diana of the dangers of junior high (especially the possibility that Luke's friends might leave him behind for the \"cooler crowd\") and intimidated by the looming presence of the bully, Meat, who constantly threatens incoming sixth graders. Luke dismisses Diana's warnings and the boys sleepover in a tent that night at A.J.'s house.\nThe following morning, the boys visit a carnival, where Steel Monkey is scheduled to perform in a talent show. Luke embarrasses himself in front of his crush, Alice, and the boys encounter Meat and his friends, who threaten them. They later visit a skate park, where experienced skateboarder Snake advises them about skating. Steel Monkey is nervous about the show, fearing their reputation in middle school is at stake.\nLuke wishes the day would never end and that he could do all he wanted with his final day of summer. Immediately afterward, and moments before their band is scheduled to perform onstage at the carnival, he is knocked unconscious by a large wooden board while returning a Frisbee. He awakens in the same tent he woke up in that morning, realizing his wish has sent him back in time. He repeats the day, trying to impress Alice, teach kindness to Meat, and impress Snake, but he is unsuccessful. He tries to avoid the board this time, but it still knocks him out. He is sent back to that morning over and over again moments before Steel Monkey's performance every single day, always getting knocked unconscious by some different, unforeseeable method, such as a football, a skateboard, and even a falling meteor. Every time, he never survives to the talent show.\nLuke begins to grow weary of the carnival as the same repeated day grows into weeks, and he starts to spend more time at the skate park, trying to impress Snake and his gang again and again to join their skate group known as \"The Pound\". Each time, Luke competes against a teenager named Gus who is also trying out for The Pound; Luke consistently embarrasses himself by screwing up the challenge, since the level of skateboarding is far beyond him; in the end, he always ends up returning to the carnival with A.J. and Riley, during which he encounters the bully Meat again and again, always trying different methods of dealing with him. He tries to relate to Meat's home life, but realizes he's making incorrect assumptions which lead Meat and his buddies to chase him down. Other days, Luke simply avoids Meat; once, he even gets revenge on Meat by tying an industrial cord to a porta potty Meat's using, and the other end to a departing truck.\nWorrying more about Diana's warning, fearing he may be left behind soon, Luke focuses less on his friends and more on the skate park, where the \"cool\" people are. He begins to ditch A.J. and Riley every morning, and they always find him later at the park.\nAfter the repeated day has accumulated over several months, Luke finally has developed enough skill that he beats Gus at the Pound tryout, and his friends are shocked when he abandons them to eagerly join the impressed members of the skate group. Diana steps in and tells Snake Luke is too young to join their group, but Snake insists that Luke can never be too young for the three N's: \"hangN, rideN, and partyN\". Luke, surprised that The Pound is nothing like his real friends, realizing maybe he isn't cut out for the group, returns to the carnival to find them. A.J. and Riley are angry with him for his lies, and blow him off.\nThe next morning, Luke is gone when A.J. and Riley wake up in the tent. He is sitting on a park bench crying, when Diana shows up and comforts him. Luke swears he's been repeating the same day, and he manages to prove a skeptical Diana by taking her to the carnival and pointing out numerous random events before they occur. Diana sympathizes with his situation, telling him she didn't mean to scare him with her warning about friends, but was only teasing him. She tells him that maybe the reason he's stuck is because he needs to change his day for the better; when his crush Alice walks by and says hi to him, Diana smiles at Luke, suggesting he begin there. She encourages him to be ready for the approaching school year and be more confident.\nLuke confronts Meat again, this time warning him against bullying, and claiming he'll tell the whole middle school Meat's real name is Melvin if he doesn't start being nicer to people. Confused, Meat agrees, and leaves. He makes a positive effort to communicate with Mr. Molesky, a teacher for the upcoming year whom Luke has previously not done a good job making an impression with over the repeated cycle. He manages to admit his feelings to Alice, and she tells him she's glad they're going to be in class that year.\nWhen Luke and his friends are waiting backstage before the concert, Luke retrieves the Frisbee that resets the cycle. However, nothing happens to him; unexpectedly, he makes it to the talent show, and though their introduction is shaky, Diana encourages Luke on; Snake joins in, and soon the crowd is cheering them on.

Danny falls through the ice in an icy room and drowns; Amanda plummets to her death in an upside-down billiards bar where parts of the floor periodically fall into a deep shaft below; Jason shocks Mike to death to solve a puzzle in a hospital room filling up with poisonous gas; and in a room with optical illusions and strobe lights, Ben kills Jason over an antidote required to escape.\nSome rooms, through songs playing, coats, and hospital beds, remind the players of them being sole survivors of various disasters; Mike escaped a mine cave-in, Zoey survived a plane crash, Danny survived when his family died of carbon monoxide poisoning, Amanda survived an IED blast, Jason survived a shipwreck in frigid weather, and Ben survived a car accident where his friends died. Zoey realizes that the purpose of the game is to determine which player is the luckiest of all. Ben, after escaping the last room where a wall moves inwards to crush him, meets the Gamemaster, who controls the game that the Puzzle Maker designed. The Gamemaster explains that each year they lure in players with something in common \u2013 college athletes, savants, etc. \u2013 and wealthy viewers bet on the result, with the current game luring in sole survivors of previous disasters. The Gamemaster tries to kill Ben, but Zoey intervenes, and together they kill the Gamemaster.\nAs Ben recovers, Zoey returns to the building with a detective. The police do not believe Zoey, as all evidence of the game has disappeared. They do not believe Ben either, as he was found to have drugs in his system. While looking at the graffiti on the wall, Zoey notices the words \"No Way Out\", an anagram for \"Wootan Yu\", suggesting the game is not over. Six months later, Zoey meets up with Ben and shows him newspaper articles that passed off the other players' deaths as everyday accidents. When Ben suggests Zoey should move on, she refuses. She reveals clues to Ben that point to an unlisted building in Manhattan. Ben agrees to go with her. However, the Puzzle Maker is already preparing to make their flight a new deadly game of survival.", "title": "Escape Room (2019 film)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q48672477"}}

solve the problem, they prepare to sit out the night.\nAfter dark, a rural man named Mick Taylor (John Jarratt) comes across them and offers to tow them to his camp to repair the car.\nInitially hesitant, the group allows Mick to take them to his place, an abandoned mining site several hours south of Wolf Creek.\nMick regales them with tall stories of his past while making a show of fixing their car.\nHis manner unsettles Liz and Kristy, although Ben is less concerned.\nWhile they sit around a fire, Mick gives the tourists water which he describes as \"rainwater from the top end\".\nThe

extinguish the blaze.\nWhen he returns Liz manages to shoot Mick with his own rifle, the bullet hitting him in the neck and apparently killing him.\nThe women attempt to flee the camp in Mick's truck.\nBut before they can do so, Mick stumbles out of the garage, revealing the gunshot was non-fatal and that he's still alive.\nHe proceeds to shoot at them with a double-barreled shotgun before

Meanwhile, Wesley and Angel fight a demon after being notified of its presence by one of Cordelia's visions.\nAt Club La Brea, Cordelia and Wilson talk, seeming to make a genuine connection. Wilson takes Cordelia home, and he spends the night there. The Phantom Dennis registers his displeasure by changing the lights and music that Cordelia selects.  She wakes the next morning to an empty bed, but she find that in the night, she has grown\u2014in a matter of hours\u2014very pregnant. Angel and Wesley are alarmed by her absence so break into the apartment. They find the pregnant Cordelia in bed.  After discovering that the phone number Wilson gave to Cordelia is no longer in service, Angel instructs Wesley to take her for an ultrasound to see exactly what it is they are dealing with, while he goes to hunt down \"daddy.\"\nStarting his search at the club where Cordelia went, Angel gains the bartender's (Josh Randall) reluctant trust and obtains information about Cordelia's \"friend\" Serena, who turns out to be the ringleader of a group of attractive young women hooking up with Wilson's group of well-heeled guys. When he gets to her apartment, Angel discovers that Serena is also heavily pregnant.\nMeanwhile, in the clinic exam room, the doctor counts seven heartbeats and, trying to conceal his agitation under a professional demeanor, orders an amniocentesis. However, the syringe containing the amniotic fluid cracks and the spilled fluid quickly eats through the floor. Dr. Wasserman and the nurse flee in terror.\nAt Serena's, Angel sits with her, asking questions that could give him some clue to Wilson's current whereabouts. Serena explains that she gets dates for Wilson and a few others, and they ask her for girls who have no family and few friends in the city. She also mentions that the money the guys use literally smells.\nSimultaneously, Serena and Cordelia double over in pain. Fading in and out of coherence, she tells Wesley that the babies are not human, and are trying to communicate with her. After Cordelia falls asleep, Wesley and Angel confer.\nAngel searches the Yellow Pages for a cigar and gun club where Serena says the men hang out. As they walk past the kitchen, they see Cordelia drinking pig's blood directly from one of Angel's jars, without her registering how strange it is.\nFinding Wilson down on the shooting range at his gun club, Angel confronts him about Cordelia. Angel sees Wilson is not a demon, but correctly guesses that the men act as surrogates for a demon in exchange for success in their careers and sex with the women.  The rest of the guys show up, and Wilson shoots Angel, but Angel fights back and forces Wilson to talk. Wesley, in the meantime, discovers that Cordelia carries the spawn of a Haxil demon. When he shows her its picture and tries to comfort her, however, Cordelia bashes Wesley unconscious with the heavy reference book. Under the demon's telepathic thrall, she fiercely protects its young.\nThe sound of Angel's phone ringing brings Wesley groggily back to consciousness. He answers and it is Angel, calling from a phone booth while manually extracting the bullets from his own torso. Frantic, Wesley tells Angel that Cordelia has left, but Angel says he knows where she's going. Comparing notes, the two men determine that the spawn can't survive if the psychic umbilical the Haxil maintains with each of the hosts is severed. Listening to Wesley's catalogue of the Haxil beast's many strengths and few weaknesses, Angel suddenly has an idea and asks Wes if he can shoot straight. Meanwhile, Cordelia and many other women impregnated by the demon gather at an old refinery fronting the entrance to the cave where the demon resides. Dressing each other in flowing white gowns, the women slowly climb into a waist-deep pool of odoriferous liquid and stand in a circle, waiting. Wesley arrives and, reverting to Watcher mode, tries to scold Cordelia and the others out of the pool, but is interrupted by the thunderous appearance of the gigantic Haxil demon emerging from its lair. Sentient and English-speaking, the towering Haxil is about to remove Wesley and begin delivering its spawn when Angel cockily appears, rolling a huge white tank, his gift for \"the baby shower,\" down the ramp in front of him. Hefting the tank, Angel whirls and launches it at the Haxil, who reflexively catches it. Before the Haxil can react to the liquid nitrogen label now visible, Wesley shoots a hole in the tank. The tank falls and sprays the escaping vapor over the demon, freezing it solid. In the tub, the women cry out as the spawn they've been carrying disappear with the broken psychic link. Cordelia climbs out, grabs a block and tackle from its anchor near his head, and swings the heavy missile directly at the frozen Haxil, shattering it to coldly smoking smithereens.\nTwo days later, Cordelia returns to the office, looking svelte and fabulous once more. She teases the boys mercilessly, then surprises and touches them both by growing sincere, letting them know how grateful she is to have two people she trusts with her life.", "title": "Expecting (Angel)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q579915"}}

dressmaking business \"The House of Eliott\".\nThrough their relationship with Penelope Maddox, the sisters meet the loyal and hardworking seamstress Tilly Watkins (played by Cathy Murphy) whom they

uneducated, but their cousin Arthur, who is executor of their father's estate, and Evie's legal guardian, keeps a rightful inheritance from the girls \"for their own good\".\nAfter Arthur's arrest and

Eliott workroom and this time is hit by a car in the road and dies.\nAt the funeral, Mr Ranby, Florence's husband, confronts Madge and Tilly after their apology to him, and then Bea and Evie, over Florence's death and the way she was treated, He particularly focuses on Bea and Evie, for not noticing the struggle, he tells the Eliott's that Florence was as loyal as they come and that she wouldn't hear a word said against them.\nLater, however, he returns, apologising for his outburst and giving some flowers to Madge and Tilly.\nHe mentions he is a tailor, and, because the House of Eliott were in desperate need of an expert cutter because of Florence's death, they consider asking him.\nThey choose against it because of the memories the House must have of Florence for him, and instead hire Charles.\nThe Eliott sisters and their employee Madge are wrapping up their evidently successful visit to the United States under the sponsorship of Sears and Roebuck, which has arranged

They bond somewhat over a shared interest in mysteries, but quickly get on each other's nerves. Two ghosts suddenly appear and chase them to the gym where a pep rally is taking place. A third ghost, The Specter, appears, demanding everyone to leave. The stamp-collecting Principal Deedle decides to close the school, but Vice Principal Grimes deems it a prank and suspends the quartet as he refuses to believe that there are ghosts in the school.\nThe gang tries to clear their names by investigating the ghosts at the school, but Shaggy and Scooby-Doo end up being locked in the cafeteria freezers. They are freed the next morning by Grimes, who turns the gang's suspension to an expulsion, and threatens to have them arrested if they're caught sneaking into the school again. Assuming the school librarian and janitor might be trying to close the school after Shaggy remembered overhearing them complaining about it, they use Daphne's knowledge of theatrical costuming to sneak into the school, but they are exonerated when Velma discovers a spell book was recently checked out by Grimes, making them think Grimes is their prime suspect. Searching at night at Grimes' house leads them to information about a time capsule buried under the school. The ghosts attack again, and the teens are knocked out.

Scooby manages to break free of his restraints and arrives just in time to subdue the Specter, who turns out to be Principal Deedle. The principal reveals that a stamp misprint was hidden within the time capsule, something that would have been worth a fortune. The time capsule was meant to be buried when a school called Coolsville Academy first opened, but a flood hit the town that day and the capsule was lost in the old school underneath the new school.

{"id": "tt1037011", "text": "The story opens in Bellwood as a mysterious black figure appears on the town\u2019s Main Street and immediately starts destroying things around him. Ben Tennyson (Graham Phillips), in the form of Heatblast (voiced by David Franklin), confronts and obliterates him after a short battle.\nThe next day, Ben goes back to school, and has trouble adjusting to normal life again. After a bad day, he gets bullied by Cash (Tyler Patrick Jones), and JT (Tyler Foden), and two girls he had tried to flirt with earlier, resulting in transforming into Grey Matter (voiced by Carlos Alazraqui) which he attempted to transform into Four Arms by getting his revenge on the bullies by causing chaos at the diner into a little food fight where Ms. Dalton (Aloma Wright) works. Later, he and Gwen Tennyson (Haley Ramm) come across the same villain Ben defeated earlier. Max Tennyson (Lee Majors) identifies him as Eon (Christien Anholt), a member of an alien species from an unknown dimension known as the Chronians, whom the Plumbers captured almost two centuries ago. When he arrived, he was half dead and brought a device with him called the Hands of Armageddon, which would open a gateway to his home dimension and unleash his race upon Earth if activated. They travel to the containment facility where Eon is supposed to be kept in suspended animation, only to find it empty and his guard aged to near-death. The guard tells Max not to let Eon find the hardware store, where the Hands were kept. Before he dies, the Plumber warns Ben that Eon is after him.\nTraveling back to Bellwood, Max takes Ben and Gwen to the location of the Hands of Armageddon, guarded by the few remaining Plumbers. Eon follows them and breaks into the facility, but cannot activate the device. When Ben attempts to use the Omnitrix, it malfunctions, glowing bright purple and giving Ben an intense burning pain. Eon attempts to kidnap Ben, claiming it to be a rescue, but Ben escapes. Eon manages to corner Ben, explaining that his race learned to control time itself, but trapped themselves by misusing their power. He claims that his fate is intertwined with Ben's. Eon is scared off by an elderly Plumber before he can elaborate. Grandpa Max decides it would be best for Ben to leave Bellwood so that Eon won't find him, but Ben bravely refuses and they both come to a deal where Ben will be monitored daily by a disguised Plumber. When Ben goes to the school gym to be alone, Principal White attempts to calm Ben's fears just when Eon freezes then reverses time as he throws White out of the way. Eon then tries to show Ben his future by disabling the Omnitrix. However, Ben sets off the fire alarm, strikes Eon in the side, and breaks out of his grasp. This time, Ben is able to become Diamondhead (voiced by Daran Norris) and fights him off. Later that night, Ben decides to lure Eon into a trap by purposefully leaving himself open, but this backfires and he is captured along with Gwen and Max.\nAt the Plumber facility storing the Hands of Armageddon, Eon explains some of the background of the Omnitrix: Ben can only remain in his alien forms for ten minutes at a time, a fail-safe to prevent them from overwhelming his human self and personality with the form's own. He also reveals that he is an evil version of Ben from an alternate timeline, which Max admits he never wanted Ben to find out. Eon knows how to deactivate the fail safe, and in doing so, can turn Ben into a Chronian. This is because the Hands need the energy of a young Chronian, which is why he kidnapped Ben. Eon presses the Omnitrix that is glowing bright purple and turns Ben into a younger evil clone of him. Meanwhile, Principal White has gotten out of the nurse's office and finds the imprisoned Plumbers. When trying to find the key to that room, they point to the button near the door, which freed them all. Gwen and Max manage to free themselves. While Max tries to disable the Hands of Armageddon at the cost of his own life, Gwen reaches to Ben inside young Eon. Ben successfully overcomes Eon and turns back to normal, and with the help of the other Plumbers, manages to save Max and disables the time rift, sending Eon's race back to their own dimension.\nJust when it seems like they've won, time stops for everyone but Ben. The older Eon reappears, angered at Ben's victory. After Ben points out that the Hands and Eon's world is gone, Eon throws Ben across the room in fury. Ben transforms into Wildmutt (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) and fights him off, eventually knocking him into the Hands of Armageddon, destroying both the Hands and Eon. Time then resumes, and Gwen takes Wildmutt to a talent show that the school is having, where they perform a magic trick and win second place. After the show, Grandpa Max recommends that it is time to put the Omnitrix away for a while and he, Ben and Gwen go for pizza. Ben admits that he will miss it. Suddenly, in space, an alien armada assembles, hinting that Ben and Max's archenemy Vilgax will return.", "title": "Ben 10: Race Against Time", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q1753093"}}
{"id": "tt1327701", "text": "The film opens as Ben, Gwen, and Kevin are negotiating with a group of black market dealers attempting to sell them alien nanochips, which are causing interference with the Omnitrix. One of them reveals herself to be Elena, a childhood friend of Ben and Gwen. Elena explains that she had set up negotiations to lure Ben out into the open, to seek his help in finding her abducted father.\nAs Ben agrees to help her, the chips spring to life and attack, controlled by a man on a catwalk. The group fights them, and in the process the suspicious man and the dealers escape. While Elena claims she is not responsible for the attack, Kevin and Gwen are suspicious of her.\nAt their headquarters, the trio, along with Grandpa Max, study one of the chips salvaged from the fight, learning that they are a hybrid of organic and technological components. Elena, having followed the trio, breaks in and Max orders her to leave, explaining that Elena's father, Victor Validus, was an apprentice of his who was dishonorably discharged after stealing the original chips. Ben refuses to believe that Elena is like her father, and breaks ranks with his grandfather and teammates to help her.\nWhile Max is away, Gwen and Kevin investigate Victor Validus and discover a video of Max interrogating Victor, in which Victor insists that \"the Hive\", the mind intelligence behind the chips, is coming to take over the planet. The chips are revealed to be able to possess people.\nMeanwhile, Ben and Elena arrive at Victor's old laboratory. It has been cleared out by the Hive, but they find evidence that Victor was studying and upgrading the chips. Elena reveals that her father had become erratic before disappearing, and had stopped returning home. He also appears to be the man from the rafters controlling the chips. A mob under the control of the chips ambush Ben and Elena, forcing them to retreat. The Omnitrix again experiences interference around the chips and keeps Ben from transforming, but Ben utilizes a scanning function on it to temporarily repel the mob and allow him and Elena to escape. They head to the Ship-It building to investigate further, though Ben is now somewhat suspicious of Elena himself, realizing the mob expected him and Elena to go to the lab and set a trap for them. Ben finds an order slip made out for that day, when Elena claimed that Victor had already been missing for weeks.\nGwen and Kevin, having reached the building first, are too late to stop the distribution of the chips. Instead, they are met by one of the Ship-It employees, who is also under the chips' control. He summons another larger chip swarm, now capable of forming solid, weaponizable shapes, to attack Gwen and Kevin, damaging Kevin's car during a lengthy chase. Ben, upon joining them, uses Humongousaur to defeat the swarm, destroying Kevin's car in the process.\nBy the time they return to headquarters, the chips have spread across the globe, and number in the millions. Gwen realizes the swarm's new ability is a sign that they can adapt to threats and become smarter. The group also deduces the chips have a queen, as the chip's hosts have mentioned her. They believed that they can stop the chips by destroying her, but during their search, Max is possessed. Pulling together, the group notice that while world population centers are all infected, Barren Rock, Missouri, has the highest concentration, an apparent anomaly in their distribution.\nInfiltrating the factory, populated by multiple infected, including Max, the group discovers that the Queen infected Elena's father, and his body is being used as a hive to rapidly mass-produce the chips. Fearing being possessed by the chips while in his alien forms, Ben uses the Omnitrix to transform into a new alien that he calls \"Nanomech\", which was created by scanning the DNA of the chips. He flies into Victor's head and battles the Queen, who briefly tries to assert dominance on him, though he resists, while Gwen, Kevin, and Elena fight the infected. As the dormant chips in the factory activate, Nanomech uses the chips ability to adapt to overwhelm and destroy the Queen, freeing everyone from the chips' control.\nIn the aftermath, Max, after apologizing to Victor, decides to retire and leave his position as leader to Ben, but Ben refuses to allow him to do so.

The night of the club's opening party, a huge frog-like monster suddenly appears and wreaks havoc. The gang decides to investigate the only person who has ever taken a picture of the lake monster, a lighthouse keeper named Mr. Uggins. He then tells them the story of the lake monster: when people were first settling Erie Point, an old woman named Wanda Grubwort (who was also a witch) warned them not to come onto her land. They paid no attention to her, so she used her magic staff - which used moonstones as the source of her power - to turn a frog into a horrible monster that attacked the villagers. Wanda was later tried for witchery and burnt at the stake.\nThe next day, Velma shows the others security footage of the lake monster meeting a mysteriously masked figure on the beach. They begin to zoom in on the figure to see its face, but Velma accidentally spills her green tea on the computer and destroys the footage. Things are complicated due to friction between Fred and Daphne, whose relationship is strained due to them regularly finding each other socializing with other people, as well as Shaggy's blossoming feelings for Velma causing him to alienate Scooby.\nThe next morning, they find Velma unconscious on the beach. Shaggy begins to tell her that he was very worried, but stops when he notices warts on her hand. Velma looks surprised, but guiltily assures them that it's nothing. After they fill her in on the latest monster attack, Daphne says that she saw purple paint on the figure's cloak and suggests they check out a boat that they saw on the way to Erie Point. Shaggy asks Velma out on a date, and things go well until he lights a match to light some candles. Velma flings herself back in terror, though she is unsure why. Scooby, who is angry at Shaggy for ignoring him, tries to ruin the date, causing Shaggy to knock over the table and drop the moonstone on the ground that he was going to give to Velma as a surprise. Fred and Daphne go to see the boat, but are then locked in a flooding room by the monster. However, they are able to escape.\nThe gang drives to the home of Mrs. Trowburg, who is Wanda's descendant. They see the witch's figure through the windows, which is a very warty Velma. She claims to not be Velma and attacks the gang, knocking them out for a moment. The gang wakes up later and find Mrs. Trowburg, who says that her evil ancestor has possessed Velma. The gang realizes that their infighting caused them to miss all the little signs - the warts, Velma's fear of fire, her love of moonstones and how she spilled the tea on the video of the witch because it was going to show her face - that should have proved Velma was up to something. Mrs. Trowburg says that Wanda probably would have gone to the underwater caves; they arrive in the cave and Shaggy bursts out of hiding and commands Velma to stop. Wanda creates three new frog monsters and sends them after the gang.\nAs the monsters corner Fred and Daphne, Shaggy tries to save Velma by singing her favorite song. Velma joins in, and manages to break free of the witch's control. The ghost of Wanda tries to grab her staff, but Scooby arrives just in time and smashes it into a rock, destroying Wanda and turning the monsters back into frogs. Shaggy confesses how much he really likes Velma and they share a kiss, but both realize that they did not feel a single spark and, along with Fred and Daphne, agree that it's better if they are just friends. Thornton thanks the gang for saving his county club and promises to hook them up with a lawyer so they can avoid any future legal problems, prompting Daphne to name their group Mystery Inc.", "title": "Scooby-Doo!

{"id": "tt0146063", "text": "War and famine have destroyed the glory of an old kingdom. The story of how a princess was discovered by a pea was lost in the process. Sebastian, a raven, tries to restore the story using an old tapestry found by a young Prince Rollo, but it is partially torn. It is written that if the legend of the pea is lost, the kingdom will fall at the reign of the 18th king who unfortunately happens to be Prince Laird, the primary candidate for the throne, who is selfish and greedy and believes that greed is what it takes to rule. With the help of Sebastian & Rollo, Laird\u2019s noble and kind younger brother Prince Heath is crowned King in accordance to the law of being the \"first\" son to enter the throne room during the ceremony, much to the chagrin of Laird. Heath proves to be a far kinder and fairer ruler, sentencing Laird to become Ruler of the Pig Kingdom where he vows revenge. Nine months later, Heath's wife Mariana delivers a daughter, but she dies during childbirth. Laird's greedy and gluttonous wife Helsa also gives birth to a daughter simultaneously. Laird conceives an evil plan to regain the crown. He sends Helsa to take care of Heath's daughter, making the King believe Helsa lost her baby. During the night, Laird swaps his and Helsa\u2019s daughter with Heath\u2019s, intending to give her away so his daughter can rule. Helsa, who feels sympathetic towards her niece as she too lost her mother at a young age, remorsefully begs Laird to give the baby to a loving family.\nYears later, Heath's daughter, named Daria, has grown into a beautiful, kind and gentle young woman. Laird is revealed to have broken his promise to Helsa, for he has instead placed Daria in the care of lazy pig herders who are hired to watch after her. Daria is forced to work for her lazy stepfamily, who treat her cruelly and lay around all day while she does all of her chores. In the meantime, her cousin Hildegarde (Laird's daughter) has matured to be cruel, wicked, selfish and vain, as intended by Laird and Helsa. She fills in Daria\u2019s place as the princess, although she treats everyone around her cruelly and acts selfishly, which does not help the Kingdom or Heath, who (believing her to be his daughter) struggles to raise her properly. She also has no idea that she is really Laird\u2019s daughter and therefore not the rightful heir to the throne. Prince Rollo, now a young man, returns to Heath's castle, dreaming of romance and happiness. However, he misinterprets the concept as he believes that the perfect woman for him must be kind and gentle, but, most importantly, must also be born into nobility. Hildegarde, upon seeing him and hearing about his wealth, decides to marry him. Rollo, repulsed by her greediness and selfishness, refuses and flees. Hildegarde sets foot to pursue him, but loses his trail. During her pursuit, Helsa encounters Laird. He \u2014 who is impressed with how his daughter turned out to be & her immediate claim for Rollo \u2014 informs Helsa that the time has come to tell Hildegarde of her true lineage (although she responds to this in anger and disgust).\nMeanwhile, Rollo, on his quest to find a bride, meets Daria, and her trusted pig companions; Princess, Hungry, and Fearless. She brings him to her \u201csecret place\u201d, where Rollo is charmed by her beauty and kindness. The two fall in love, but are forced to separate. Despite having feelings for Daria, Rollo rejects the idea of marrying her since she isn\u2019t a princess. Rollo continues in his search for a real princess to marry, desiring a woman of proper lineage, beauty, grace, and class. Unfortunately, while he does encounter beautiful princesses, they all sadly disappoint him due to their spoiled personalities and pampered lifestyles. Rollo realizes he shouldn't love someone because of their titles, but because of who they are. Upon this realization, he realizes that Daria is the right person for him and rushes to confess his rekindled feelings for her.\nMeanwhile, Sebastian has been searching for a lost prophecy that dictates: \u201cto discover true nobility, one must place a pea beneath twenty mattresses\u201d. Unfortunately, his search to discover the mystery of peas always ends in vain. Meanwhile, King Heath admits that he is greatly disappointed with Hildegarde\u2019s upbringing. Nonetheless, he finds solace in knowing that Rollo has found the girl of his dreams, as her personality bears a striking resemblance to his late wife. He then decides to disinherit Hildegarde and leaves his kingdom to Rollo and his chosen bride-to-be. He asks Sebastian to deliver the important message to Rollo. Learning about Heath's plan, Helsa has her and Laird\u2019s pet falcon, Plague, intercept the message and bring it to Laird's attention. Laird turns the entire Pig Kingdom against Daria, claiming she is a witch who can talk to animals. A mob pursues her through the forest and burn down her hiding place, where she and Rollo first met.\nRollo returns to the kingdom in an attempt to save Daria, not knowing she had already escaped with the help of her animal companions. Sebastian finally discovers the full prophecy in the ballroom of Daria's hiding place, which turns out to be the original palace from where the prophecy originated from. Above the prophecy is a stained glass window that bears the image of an unnamed queen, Daria's ancestor, who brought about the Golden Age of the Kingdom before it was overtaken by its Dark Age.\nThe prophecy reads:\n\"To Reveal the Heart of True Nobility\nPlace the Pea Twenty Mattresses Deep\nThe Princess True is Love and Sensitivity\nUpon Such, She Can Never Sleep\"\nDelighted at solving the obstinate mystery, Sebastian celebrates, not aware that the building has caught on fire. Rollo rescues him and the pair exit the smoldering structure. Weak from smoke inhalation, he cries out for Daria before passing out in front of the mob. Laird lies to the crowd, telling them that he cried for Hildegarde and wants to marry her. Rollo is taken to the castle and treated for his injuries. Upon hearing the speculation of his wish to marry Hildegarde, Heath plans the wedding. Hildegarde's orders dictate that the wedding is to take place the moment Rollo heals. While mourning Daria, whom he believes to be dead, he decides to go through with the wedding, disheartened and believing that he has nothing left to lose.\nDaria, determined to find Rollo and fed up with the abuse she was put through, finally leaves her stepfamily. She tries to find Rollo and is rudely pushed aside by the people. She helps Sasha, a servant who fell and hurt herself and lets her into the castle. Sebastian appears after awakening from a head injury and is informed of the impending wedding. Seeing Sebastian's twenty feather beds, Daria decides to lie down for a moment. Desperate for a solution to their predicament, Sebastian allows her to test the pea within the mattresses. It seems all hope is lost when she appears to be able to sleep peacefully, but soon Daria finds that she is unable to sleep, as there is something hard underneath them. Seeing this, Sebastian deduces that Daria is the Princess true for she felt the pea through twenty mattresses. He then sees Daria's birthmark, a heart on her foot, which he remembers the Princess having when he saw her many years ago as a baby, finally realizing that Daria is Heath\u2019s real daughter and the true heir to the throne. He plans to tell everyone of the birthmark, but is intercepted when Laird and Helsa capture and imprison him. He escapes with the help of Fearless and interrupts the wedding, revealing the truth. Hildegarde is forced to show her foot at the behest of everyone as evidence, which shows a birthmark similar to Daria\u2019s, but before the wedding can continue, Rollo's dog; Winthrop licks her foot, revealing the birthmark to be paint. Before telling everyone of the real claimant to the title, Laird shows up, holding Daria hostage. He tries to eliminate Rollo by throwing a chandelier on top of him, but he is rescued by Heath, who is seemingly killed. Miraculously, he regains consciousness and demands the release of his daughter, angering Laird.\nLaird, along with Helsa and Hildegarde, flee with Daria accompanying them. He sets up a trap to get rid of Rollo, whom he knows to be following him. Thanks to Fearless setting off traps, Rollo confronts Laird and survives another attempt to kill him. Atop the castle\u2019s tower, Rollo finds Hildegarde holding Daria hostage, threatening to toss her over the side. Laird knocks Rollo off the edge, causing him to dangle for life and orders Plague to end him. Thankfully, Rollo is saved by Sebastian and Daria. Together, they defeat Laird by throwing him into the moat below, just before he is about to attack Rollo yet again. When Hildegarde attempts to kill Daria and nearly falls to her death, Rollo saves Daria. Fearless scares Hildegarde, who also falls in the moat. Laird, Helsa, and Hildegarde are then arrested for their transgressions. Fearless (who was initially cowardly in the beginning of the film) finally lives up to his name by helping the crew defeat Hildegarde.\nRollo and Daria are reunited. He introduces her to Heath, not having seen her since her infancy. Heath is delighted to see that Daria grew up to be just like Mariana, and not at all like Hildegarde, and celebrates having been reunited with his daughter at last. The couple marry in the ancient kingdom and live happily ever after.", "title": "The Princess and the Pea (2002 film)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q3209277"}}
{"id": "tt0085933", "text": "In 1942, Captain Yonoi (Sakamoto) is the commander of a POW camp in Japanese-occupied Java. A strict adherent to the bushido code, his only sources of connection to the prisoners lie in the empathetic Lt. Col. John Lawrence (Conti), the only inmate fluent in Japanese, and the abrasive spokesman Gp. Capt. Hicksley (Thompson), who repeatedly resists Yonoi's attempts to find weapons experts among the prisoners for the Japanese army's interests. Lawrence has befriended Sgt. Gengo Hara (Kitano), but remains at odds with the rest of the staff. Summoned to the military trial of the recently-captured major Jack Celliers (Bowie), Yonoi is fascinated by his resilience and has him interred at the camp. After the trial, Yonoi confides with Lawrence that he is haunted with shame thanks to his absence during the February 26 Incident, believing he should've died alongside the rebels and implying that his focus on honor stems from this. Sensing a kindred spirit in Celliers, Yonoi's fascination grows into a romantic obsession: he treats him specially, watches him sleep, and repeatedly asks Hara about him in private.\nWhen the inmates are made to fast as punishment for insubordination during the forced seppuku of a guard (Okura), Celliers sneaks in food. The guards catch him and find a smuggled radio during the subsequent investigation, forcing him and Lawrence to take the blame. Yonoi's batman, realizing the hold Celliers has on him, attempts to kill Celliers in his sleep that night, but fails after he wakes up and escapes, freeing Lawrence too. Yonoi catches Celliers and challenges him to a duel in exchange for his freedom, but Celliers refuses; the batman returns and commits suicide for his failure, urging Yonoi to kill Celliers before his feelings overpower him. At the funeral, Lawrence learns that he and Celliers will be executed for the radio, despite the lack of evidence, to preserve order in the camp; enraged, he trashes the funeral set and is forced back into his cell. That night, Celliers reveals to Lawrence that as a teenager, he betrayed his younger brother, long bullied for his hunchback, by refusing to spare him a humiliating and traumatizing initiation ritual at their boarding school. Confronting his own ableism, he describes the lifelong shame he felt towards his actions, paralleling Yonoi's predicament. During their conversation, the pair are released by a drunken Hara, as a different prisoner confessed to delivering the radio. As they leave, Hara calls out in English, \"Merry Christmas, Lawrence!\" Although Yonoi is angry at Hara for exceeding his authority, he only mildly reprimands him.\nHicksley, realizing that Yonoi wants to replace him with Celliers as spokesman, confronts him. The two argue over their withholding of information from one another before an enraged Yonoi orders the whole camp to form up outside the barracks, including the sick bay's ailing patients, resulting in one's death. Hicksley, who refused to bring out the patients, is punished for his insubordination with an on-the-spot execution. Before he can be killed, however, Celliers breaks rank and kisses Yonoi on each cheek, choosing to save Hicksley's life at the cost of his own. Caught between a desire for vindication and his feelings for Celliers, a distraught Yonoi collapses and is ultimately relieved from duty. His more rigid replacement (Murota) has Celliers buried in the sand up to his neck and left to die. Before leaving, Yonoi sneaks into his pen and cuts a lock from his hair, moments before his passing.\nFour years later, Lawrence visits Hara, who is now a prisoner of the Allies. Hara has learned to speak English and reveals he is to be executed the following day for war crimes. Expressing confusion over the harshness of his sentence given how commonplace his actions were among both sides of the war, he and Lawrence both conclude that while the Allies officially won, morally \"we are all wrong.\" The two reminisce on Celliers and Yonoi, the latter of whom was also executed after the war, before bidding each other goodbye.

One of only a handful of Americans amongst the British and Australian inmates, he thrives through his conniving and black market enterprises; whereas others, nearly all of higher rank, struggle to survive sickness and starvation while trying to keep their civilised nature. King recruits upper class British RAF officer Flight Lieutenant Peter Marlowe to act as a translator. As they become acquainted, Marlowe comes to like the man and appreciate his cunning. King respects Marlowe, but his attitude is otherwise ambiguous; when Marlowe is injured, King obtains expensive medicines to save Marlowe's gangrenous arm from amputation, but, despite the fact he stays by the sick man's bedside, it is unclear whether he does so out of friendship or because Marlowe is the only one who knows where the proceeds from King's latest and most profitable venture are hidden.\nKing has a different relationship with the lower class, seemingly-incorruptible British Provost, First Lieutenant Grey. Grey has only contempt for the American and does his best to bring him down. Then Grey has to deal with an unrelated dilemma when he accidentally discovers that the high-ranking officer in charge of the meagre food rations has been stealing. Grey rejects a bribe and zealously takes the matter to Colonel George Smedley-Taylor. To his dismay, Smedley-Taylor tells him the corrupt officer and his assistant have been relieved of their duties, and orders him to forget all about it. Grey accuses Smedley-Taylor of being in on the scheme, but the tampered weight he presented to the colonel as evidence has been replaced, so he no longer has proof of the crime. Smedley-Taylor offers to promote him to acting captain: when a troubled Grey does not respond, Smedley-Taylor takes his silence as consent.\nThe core idea in the film, and title, is that King starts breeding rats and selling the meat to the guards, telling them it is mouse-deer. The British love of animals is doubly offended when a pet dog is required to be killed for killing a chicken, but is put to good use when it itself is cooked. A chosen few relish the meat. The stakes are raised when they get a diamond to sell. In the camp politics the collusion with the guards show them as almost equals, and it is the British Lieutenant (Courtenay) who represents the \"evil\" of the system, in his suppression of all enjoyment and enforcement of the internal rules.\nThe British camp commandant summons the four other senior British officers, and they are required to go to the Japanese commanders quarters. There the commander reads a scroll while a junior officer translates. This notifies them that the Japanese have surrendered, and that the war is over.  After overcoming their shock and disbelief, the prisoners celebrate \u2013 all except King. He realises he is no longer the unquestioned (if unofficial) ruler of the camp. \nWeaver, a lone British paratrooper appears from seemingly nowhere, walks up to the prison gates and fires a revolver in the air causing the guards to surrender. The prisoners are stunned and are too shocked by the sudden events to speak to the paratrooper, except King. That King appears fit and is well-dressed among the other prisoners clad in rags makes the paratrooper suspicious and accusatory as to how that could be. King manages to squelch a premature attempt by resentful underling First sergeant Max to reassert his rank and authority, but that only delays the inevitable. When Marlowe speaks to him before King's departure from the camp, King belittles it, saying \"you worked for me, and I paid you\".\nAustralian medics arrive and take care of the wounded. They begin a checklist of inmates against the records. The Americans are put on a truck ahead of the British. Marlowe rushes to say goodbye, but is too late, and simply watches the truck of men drive off.", "title": "King Rat (film)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q1353594"}}

{"id": "tt0106452", "text": "Steve Malone, an agent from the Environmental Protection Agency, is sent to a military base in Alabama to test possible effects on the surrounding ecological system caused by military actions. With him is his teenage daughter from his first marriage, Marti, his second wife Carol, and Marti's half brother Andy. On their way to the base, they stop at a gas station. In the restroom, Marti is threatened by an MP member with a knife. When he notices her fear, he lets go of her, satisfied that she shows an emotional response. Before she leaves the room, he warns her, \"they get you when you sleep\".\nSteve and his family move into their new home on the base, and Marti makes friends with the base commander's daughter Jenn. On his first day in day care, Andy runs away because he is recognized as an outsider among the other somehow conformist children. He is picked up and brought home by helicopter pilot Tim. Marti and Tim quickly feel attracted to each other. Meanwhile, while examining soil samples, Steve is approached by medical officer Major Collins, who asks him about psychological effects, particularly narcophobia (the fear of sleep), and their possible relation to toxication of the environment. Steve believes that a physiological reaction would be more likely.\nIn the evening, Marti and Jenn go to the bar attended by the station's military personnel, where they meet not only Tim but also the MP who threatened Marti at the gas station. He denies that they ever met before. That night, a group of soldiers can be seen picking giant pods from the river running by the base. When Andy wakes up and enters his mother's room, Carol's body crumbles to dust, while a naked soulless double emerges from the closet. Nobody believes Andy's story that his real mother is dead and the person pretending to be Carol is only an impostor.\nThe following night, Marti and her father are nearly \"taken over\" too by duplicates emerging from the giant pods. Carol attempts to convince Steve that the takeover is a good thing, claiming that it ends confusion and anger. She also claims that there's no place to go, as the events at the base are not an isolated incident. Steve is almost shocked and saddened into compliance, but Marti and Andy drag him out the door. Carol emits a shrill and mechanical scream that alerts other \"pod people\" to the presence of a human being. Now the majority in numbers, they swarm over the base chasing the remaining humans.\nAfter hiding Marti and Andy in a warehouse, Steve enters Major Collins' office. The hysterical Major tries to call for help, but the line is blocked. While swallowing sleep-prevention pills Collins announces that it is too late to run; all they can do is fight. Their conversation is interrupted by the arrival of a group of pod people, led by base commander General Platt. While Steve hides, the pod people try to convince the Major that the individual is not important, and that only conformity can solve the world's problems. The Major shoots himself rather than live in such a world.\nSteve returns to his children and tells them to follow him, claiming to have found a way out. They drive aimlessly through the military base, as loudspeakers shout out instructions for spreading the invasion by carrying out pods in trucks. Realizing that her father was replicated while he was away, Marti swerves the car to the side and tries to escape with her brother. Tim, who escaped his former comrades who tried to turn him into one of them, suddenly appears and Marti takes his gun and shoots the Steve duplicate. Pod Steve's body shrinks into a mass of seething, bloody goo.\nTim manages to get hold of a helicopter gunship, but Marti and Andy are taken away by the pod people. They sedate both of them and take them to the base infirmary where the remaining human beings are being systematically duplicated by pods. Tim is able to rescue Marti, despite her naked pod duplicate trying to seduce him. Incomplete, it dies when he pulls its connecting tendrils off Marti.\nMarti and Tim leave the building, pretending to be pod people so they can get to Tim's helicopter to escape. However, they are spotted by Jenn, now a pod duplicate, who gets suspicious and tells Marti she saw Andy looking for her. When Marti reacts by displaying emotion, Jenn responds by giving out a pod scream to alert the other pod people. Tim and Marti manage to get in the helicopter and are joined at the last minute by Andy who runs up to them. But right after taking off, Andy, who is actually a pod duplicate, attacks both and tries to bring down the helicopter. After a short scuffle, a heartbroken Marti is forced to throw Pod-Andy out of the helicopter and he gives out a pod scream while falling to his death.\nThe ending of the film is an ambiguous one. Tim destroys the trucks filled with pods with the helicopter's rockets, while Marti confesses her profound hatred in a voice-over narration, thereby hinting at a loss of humanitarian quality. While they land on another base, the words of Marti's replaced stepmother earlier in the film can be heard, suggesting that the phenomenon may have already spread beyond the army base: \"Where you gonna go, where you gonna run, where you gonna hide?

He is being hunted by the Paladins, a secret society of religious fanatics who are sworn to trace and kill \"Jumpers\" for their alleged omnipresence which they find blasphemous. Roland Cox, leader of the Paladins, learns of David's identity from Mark, who bullied David in high school. David and his high school crush Millie go to Rome, keeping his ability a secret. When they visit the Colosseum, they are bombarded by a group of Paladins, whom another Jumper, Griffin, casually kills. David is detained by Italian police and questioned about the deaths, but escapes with the help David's mother, Mary, who left him when he was five. Millie, upset and afraid when David tries to skirt around the issue, demands to know the truth. David declines and puts her on a plane home.\nDavid runs into Griffin again, and follows him to his hideout in a cave. Griffin reveals that he has been trailing and killing Paladins for years and plans to kill Roland to avenge his parents. Griffin tells David that the Paladins will target his loved ones to draw him out. David teleports home and finds his father lying bleeding. He jumps his father to a hospital and returns to Griffin to ask for help. Realizing Roland is personally hunting David, Griffin agrees.\nThey go to pick Millie up at the airport, but she is no longer there. Griffin returns to his hideout to get weapons. David breaks into Millie's apartment, angering her. Seeing Roland arriving, David decides to reveal the truth to her. He teleports her to Griffin's hideout.

David sees his mother's photo on the wall and realizes she is also a Paladin. Roland is chased back through the jump scar, but he manages to snatch Millie with him. He sets up a trap in Millie's apartment, expecting David to come back for her.\nObsessed with killing Roland, Griffin plans to bomb the apartment, but David objects, wanting to save Millie. They fight and David traps Griffin with power lines in Chechnya. Ignoring Griffin's warning, David jumps to Millie's apartment and is quickly trapped by Roland's cables. The cables \"link\" him to the apartment, making him unable to jump away alone. Mustering his strength, David teleports the apartment and everyone inside to a river. Once free of the cables, David teleports Millie to safety and dumps Roland in a cave in Horseshoe Bend. He strands Roland there, telling him \"I could have dropped you with the sharks\".\nDavid visits his long-lost mother Mary and discovers his younger half-sister Sophie. Mary tells David that when he was five, he made his very first jump. She is a Paladin and had to either kill David or leave.

Forced to stay overnight in the town, Liz meets Sarah Austin (Hudson Leick), a reporter for a tabloid newspaper, who is in town to investigate legends of living scarecrows. The townspeople of Hope once sacrificed people by nailing them to crosses in the cornfields until a young girl alerted residents of the nearby town of Liberty. Horrified to learn of the murders going on in Hope, the townspeople of Liberty nailed the local preacher who spearheaded the sacrifices to a cross. Legend contends that one day he will be reborn.\nSarah persuades Liz to accompany her to the cornfield. At the cornfield, Sarah takes photos of a scarecrow that she and Liz construct and hang on a cross, intending to use the photograph for the newspaper's front page. Sarah is later attacked and killed by the scarecrow, which comes to life. The scarecrow tries to kill Liz as well but she manages to escape in the squad car of a deputy, who is killed upon arriving at the scene.\nShe drives to the sheriff's office, where she tells her tale. When the deputy is unable to reach anyone by radio or phone, he leaves Liz alone while he goes to find out the problem. Liz is able to fend off the scarecrow when it arrives, stalking her. She tries to flee in her car but sees that the engine has been removed. She takes refuge with the town's preacher (Ethan Phillips), but discovers that the preacher is the leader of the townspeople, who worship the spirit of the founding preacher.

{"id": "tt1674784", "text": "The film opens with fast-talking businessman and diamond dealer Kyle Miller (Nicolas Cage) speaking to a client over the phone as he returns to his lavish mansion home, his wife Sarah (Nicole Kidman) and his teenage daughter Avery (Liana Liberato).\nDespite the charming facade, it is immediately clear that the family is dysfunctional and emotionally distant: Avery disrespects her parents and, despite being forbidden to do so, sneaks out of the house to go to a party with her friend Kendra.\nSarah appears bored with life as a housewife and yearns for more in her marriage while Kyle seems to harbor a hidden aversion towards his wife.\nJust as Kyle is about to leave for a business transaction, the house is suddenly invaded by a gang of robbers masquerading as police.\nThe thieves, consisting of leader Elias (Ben Mendelsohn), his stripper girlfriend Petal (Jordana Spiro), his younger brother Jonah (Cam Gigandet), and a large intimidating man named Ty (Dash Mihok), tell Kyle and Sarah that they have been spying on them for some time and are aware of the large amounts of cash and diamonds hidden in their home.\nThey command Kyle to open a safe hidden in the wall but, despite the threat of a syringe containing lethal injection chemicals, he defiantly refuses, believing that he and Sarah will be killed if he simply gives in to their demands.\nSarah, meanwhile, recognizes Jonah through his mask.\nThrough a series of Jonah's flashbacks and a conversation with Elias, it is strongly implied that Sarah and Jonah had a previous affair when the latter was employed as a technician to install the house's security system.\nUnbeknownst to Elias, Sarah secretly steals the syringe from him during this conversation.\nHaving left her party in disgust (after the host Jake clumsily attempted to seduce her), Avery returns home and, after a brief chase, is also captured and taken to her parents.\nElias appeals to Kyle, claiming that he needs money to pay for a kidney transplantation for his dying mother and that, if Kyle refuses to comply, he will instead take one of Avery's kidneys.\nSarah catches Elias off-guard and holds him hostage with the syringe.\nForced into a Mexican standoff, the thieves compromise by letting Avery escape in exchange for Kyle opening the safe.\nHe does so, revealing it to be completely empty.\nKyle explains that he is actually bankrupt and has no money; his house and all of his possessions were bought on loaned credit.\nEnraged, Elias breaks Kyle's hand and instead demands material compensation by taking Sarah's prized diamond necklace.\nHowever, Kyle reveals that this too is a fake cubic zirconia replica and is completely worthless.\nTy recaptures Avery from outside and brings her back into the house.\nKyle volunteers for his own kidney to be taken instead of his daughter's, but Elias reveals that it was a ploy and that he hated his mother, who is already dead.\nTy grows impatient after receiving a phone call and commands Elias to hurry up; Kyle realizes that the burglars are themselves being coerced into committing the heist against their will.\nThe thieves then separate the Miller family, with Kyle and Avery being tied up and guarded in the living room and Sarah being pursued by Jonah in the kitchen.\nJonah states to Sarah that he still loves her and promises that she and Avery will be left unhurt.\nMeanwhile, Kyle uses a lighter to burn both his own and Avery's binds; they attempt an escape and set off the house's security system.\nKyle ends up in a struggle with Ty, and, despite Ty's superior strength and fighting skills, Kyle manages to inject a portion of the syringe chemicals into his arm, causing him to fall unconscious.\nThinking that Ty is dead, Elias shoots Kyle in the leg and reveals his true motives: that he is a drug dealer working for an organized crime syndicate.\nShortly after being given a job to sell $180,000 worth of cocaine, Elias and Petal were carjacked at gunpoint and all of their shipments were promptly stolen.\nFaced with threats of retribution, Elias was then forced to commit a heist (under the supervision of henchman Ty) to pay off his debt.\nJonah, who had previously seen the Miller residence, suggested it as a place to rob.\nAvery attempts to run out of the house again but is caught by Jonah.\nUnder the threat of her parents being killed, she is forced to answer a call from the security company and successfully convinces them to call off the police.\nHowever, a security guard shows up nevertheless, with Sarah ordered to make him leave, but the security guard catches sight of Jonah and recognises him as a colleague, prompting Jonah to shoot him in the head.\nKyle reveals to Elias that the only thing of any worth on him is his life insurance.\nDesperate and out of options, Elias kicks Kyle down and prepares to kill him.\nAt the last second, Avery remembers the money she saw at the earlier party and pleads with the thieves that she can help them steal it from the party if they spare her father's life.\nElias reluctantly agrees to the proposition and sends Petal to supervise Avery as she drives to the party house and ensure that she keeps her word (during a conversation between Elias and Petal it's revealed their daughter was taken into care).\nAlthough Avery's initial idea is to seduce Jake and then steal his money, she is horrified when Petal begins to deliriously proclaim that she plans to massacre all of the party guests and then take the cash.\nSeeing a swerving road ahead, Avery accelerates the car, unbuckles Petal's seat belt, and intentionally crashes into a telephone pole, incapacitating Petal and allowing Avery to handcuff Petal to the steering wheel.\nBack at the Miller home, Sarah learns that Kyle had discovered a picture of her kissing Jonah from security footage and was suspicious for some time that she had been unfaithful.\nSarah, however, insists that she is innocent and only loves Kyle: the same flashback is now shown from her perspective, revealing that Jonah is in fact mentally ill (and off his medications) and that the supposed love affair between him and Sarah was all in his head.\nThe \"kiss\" had occurred to Sarah's complete surprise and against her will.\nAt this point, Ty reawakens from his stupor and attacks Sarah.\nEnraged, Jonah tackles Ty and the two fight.\nJust as Ty is about to strangle Jonah to death, Elias shoots him in the back for trying to kill his brother.\nHowever, in his dying breath, Ty reveals to Elias that he had been set up all along: the \"robbers\" stealing his cocaine shipment were actually fellow members of the same crime organization and the operation was done in order to blackmail him into stealing more money for them.\nMore damningly, Ty also claims that Jonah had masterminded the entire plan so he could have an excuse to return to the Miller residence and profess his love to Sarah.\nElias is shocked by the allegations but refuses to believe them (though doubt about his brother does seem to creep in)  Through the chaos, Sarah and a wounded Kyle escape to the tool shed behind the house and are pursued by Elias and Jonah.\nAfter a brief fight, the thieves break through a partition in their tussling and to their surprise discover a large amount of money that's been hidden in the shed; Kyle reveals that he had sold Sarah's real diamond necklace and was saving the money as a nest egg for his family when he noticed his business/fortunes declining.\nAs Elias and Jonah begin to collect the cash, Avery appears (having survived the car crash with minor injuries) and points a gun at them.\nElias calls her bluff and claims she can shoot but he will still have time to shoot one of her parents, he then aims his gun at Sarah - but he is shot, from behind, and killed by Jonah for this.\nJonah tries again to convince Sarah that she belongs with him but she rebuffs his offers, calling him insane.\nIn an attempt to sacrifice himself, Kyle tells his wife and daughter to run while setting the money in the tool shed on fire.\nHe also shoots Jonah's foot with a nail gun, trapping him in the shed.\nWhile Avery goes to call the police, Sarah tries to help Kyle but she is grabbed in a last-ditch effort by Jonah, who is convinced that it is destiny for her to die together with him in the fire.\nHowever, Kyle then shoots him in the neck, causing him to fall and become engulfed in the flames.\nSarah then carries Kyle away to safety just as the shed collapses.\nIn the backyard, Kyle tries to tell Sarah to let him die so that she and Avery can survive on his life insurance fund but she refuses, stating that she loves him regardless of whether he has money or not.\nAvery runs back to her parents announcing that help is finally on the way.\nThe three family members embrace as the real police arrive and surround the house.", "title": "Trespass (2011 film)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q185764"}}

At their cottage, the witches cast a spell on Emily to absorb her youth and regain their own, killing her in the process. Thackery confronts the witches, but is transformed into a black cat cursed with immortality. Suddenly, the townsfolk, led by Thackery's friend, Elijah, and Binx's father, immediately arrest the sisters and sentence them to be hanged for the murder of Thackery and Emily. Before their execution, Winifred casts a spell that will resurrect the sisters during a full moon on All Hallows' Eve when any virgin lights the Black Flame Candle. Thackery decides to guard the cottage to ensure no one summons the witches.\nThree centuries later, on October 31, 1993, Max Dennison is feeling unsettled from his family's sudden move from Los Angeles, California, to Salem. On Halloween, Max takes his younger sister Dani out trick-or-treating, where they meet Max's new crush Allison. In an effort to impress Allison, Max invites her to show him the Sanderson house to convince him the witches were real.\nInside the Sanderson cottage, now a former museum, Max lights the Black Flame Candle and inadvertently resurrects the witches due to his virginity. The witches attempt to suck the soul of Dani, but Max comes to her rescue. Escaping, Max steals Winifred's spellbook (grimoire) on advice from Thackery, who now goes by his last name of Binx. The witches pursue them to an old cemetery, where Winifred raises her unfaithful lover Billy Butcherson as a zombie to chase them on foot.\nThe witches try to acclimate to the 20th century, but are horrified when they discover Halloween has become a festival of disguises. They pursue the children across town using Mary's enhanced sense of smell. Max, Dani, and Allison find their parents at the City Hall Halloween party, where Winifred enchants the partygoers to dance until they die. At Jacob Bailey High School, the children trap the witches in a kiln to burn them alive. While the children are celebrating, the witches' curse revives them again.\nNot realizing the witches have survived, Max and Allison open the spellbook intending to reverse the spell on Binx. The open spellbook reveals the location of the group, and the witches track them down, kidnap Dani and Binx, and recover the spellbook. Sarah uses her siren-like song to entice Salem's children, luring them to the Sanderson cottage. Max and Allison rescue Dani and Binx by tricking the witches into believing that sunrise was an hour early. Thinking that they are done for, the witches panic and pass out, allowing Max, Dani, Allison, and Binx to escape.\nBack at the cemetery, the group is ambushed by Billy who then takes Max's knife, cuts open his stitched up mouth, and insults Winifred, therefore joining Max, Allison, Dani and Binx against the witches. The witches attack, and Winifred attempts to use the last vial of potion to suck the soul from Dani. Binx leaps on Winifred and knocks the potion out of her hand. Max drinks the potion, forcing the witches to take him instead of Dani. The sun starts to rise just as Winifred is about to finish draining Max's life force; in the ensuing struggle, Allison, Dani, and Billy fend off Mary and Sarah, and Max and Winifred fall onto the hallowed ground in the cemetery, causing Winifred to turn into stone. As the sun finishes rising above the horizon, Mary and Sarah are disintegrated into dust along with Winifred's stone body.\nWith the witches gone, Max, Dani, and Allison say goodbye to Billy, as he returns to his grave.

However, Italian navigator Christopher Columbus theorizes that the Earth is a cube, which negatively affects his cartography. An adventuring woodworm named Pico eats away the corners of Columbus' cube globe, which convinces him that the Earth is round. With the prospect of falling off the Earth eliminated, Columbus concludes that he could reach the Indies faster by sea travel than Marco Polo had done by land, and he goes to present his theory to King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella in the hope of receiving funding for an expedition. Columbus' proposal outrages King Ferdinand, but Queen Isabella is won over by her own attraction to Columbus as well as his promise of spices, gold and jewelry, and she grants his request for three ships. King Ferdinand, not expecting Columbus to return, agrees to the voyage, but tells Columbus that if he does not return with gold, he will be executed. Meanwhile, Pico snoops around the castle and meets Marilyn, the princess of the moon sprites. Marilyn's land was invaded by the Swarm Lord, and she had been kept prisoner in the castle's chandelier until she reveals the secret of her powers to him. Pico and Marilyn attempt to escape, but the Swarm Lord returns and takes Marilyn to his kingdom in the still-undiscovered New World.\nThe next day, Columbus is about to set sail on the Santa Maria to discover the New World. Pico rushes to the ship, but is stopped by a trio of rats, who plan to eat him. Pico informs the rats of a food supply on Columbus' ship, but they leave Pico behind, and he narrowly reaches the ship by hitching a ride on a passing seagull. The rats, having learned that the ship is sailing to the supposed end of the world, attempt to steal Columbus' lifeboat and flee, but Pico dissuades them from the theft by convincing them that the New World is a land of cheese. Pico reunites with Columbus and explains that he needs to save Marilyn. Columbus' crewmates overhear their captain talking to Pico and come to the conclusion that Columbus is crazy. That night, Pico overhears the crew plotting to kill Columbus to avoid sailing off the Earth's edge. Columbus, upon Pico's warning, placates the crew with a song about heroic sailors. The next day, the crew's morale drops once more when a supposed island turns out to be a deserted Viking ship. As the crew try to hang Columbus, he sees the New World from the mast. The Swarm Lord appears and attempts to destroy the ship, but it manages to make it ashore.\nPico, Columbus, a beaver and two surviving rats venture through the island's jungle and reach the Swarm Lord's Aztec temple. As the Swarm Lord attempts to steal Marilyn's powers, Pico rescues her while Columbus climbs to the top of the Swarm Lord's giant honeycomb and takes a golden idol. Columbus uses the idol to squash the Swarm Lord, and the beaver destroys the temple by chewing through the honeycomb. The team escapes, but Marilyn drowns in a waterfall and is found lifeless on a floating flower. Once the sun rises, she comes back to life and Pico and Marilyn kiss. The natives of the island thank Columbus for destroying the Swarm Lord. The group sail off back to Spain, and Columbus is happy knowing that he discovered the New World and proved that the world is round.", "title": "The Magic Voyage", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q3382526"}}

the discovery.\nThey travel to the Norwegian base, Thule Station, located in Antarctica nearS.\nOutpost 31, in a helicopter manned by Carter (Joel Edgerton), Derek (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), and Griggs (Paul Braunstein).\nAfter viewing the spacecraft, Kate, Sander, and Adam are told the group also discovered an alien body from the crash, buried in the ice nearby.\nIn the afternoon the body is brought to the base in a block of ice.\nThat evening, while the team celebrates their find, Derek sees the alien burst from the ice and escape the building.\nThe team searches for the creature and discovers that it killed Lars' dog.\nOlav and Henrik find the alien, which then grabs and engulfs Henrik.\nThe rest of the group arrive and set fire to the creature, killing it.\nAn autopsy of the scorched alien corpse reveals that its cells were consuming and imitating Henrik's own.\nDerek, Carter, Griggs and a sick Olav take the helicopter to seek help.\nKate discovers bloody dental fillings near a blood-soaked shower.\nShe runs outside to flag down the helicopter after it takes off.\nWhen it attempts to land, Griggs transforms into the Thing and attacks Olav, causing the helicopter to spin out of control and crash in the mountains.\nWhen Kate returns to the shower, she finds the blood is gone.\nThe team decides to send a party to the closest base, but Kate confronts them with her theory that the Thing can imitate them and has likely already done so.\nThey dismiss her claims, but Juliette says she saw Colin leaving the showers.\nWhen Juliette and Kate look for the vehicle keys to prevent the others from leaving, Juliette transforms and tries to attack Kate.\nAs Kate flees, she runs past Karl, who is impaled by the creature.\nLars arrives with a flamethrower and burns the creature just as it assimilates Karl.\nAt nightfall, they burn the remains of the Juliette-Thing and Karl's body.\nThat night, Edvard, Kate and Lars find Carter and Derek stumbling into base, half frozen.\nThe team refuses to believe that they could have survived the crash.\nKate has them isolated until a test can be prepared to verify they are human.\nAdam and Sander had started to work on a test, but the lab is set on fire in the few minutes it's left unattended.\nKate proposes another test, believing that the Thing cannot imitate inorganic material.\nShe inspects everyone and singles out those without amalgam dental fillings: Sander, Edvard, Adam, and Colin, while herself, Peder, Jonas and Lars are proven human.\nLars and Jonas go to retrieve Carter and Derek for testing, and discover they have broken out.\nAs Lars searches a nearby building, he is suddenly pulled inside.\nThe group hears Carter and Derek breaking into the building and rushes to intercept them.\nIn the middle of a standoff, Edvard orders Peder to burn them.\nBefore he can, Derek shoots Peder dead in self-defense with Lars' gun, but also punctures the flamethrower's fuel tank, setting off an explosion that knocks Edvard unconscious.\nWhen brought to the rec room, Edvard transforms and infects Jonas and kills Derek before assimilating Adam.\nKate torches the infected Jonas and Derek's body before she and Carter pursue the Thing.\nWhile the pair searches, Sander is ambushed by the Thing and Colin hides in the radio room and isn't seen again.\nThey get separated and the Thing, into which Edvard and Adam are now fused, corners Carter in the kitchen, but Kate burns it before it can kill him.\nThey then see an infected Sander drive off into the blizzard and pursue him in the remaining snowcat.\nWhile they are pursuing Sander, Kate notices that Carter is wearing his gold earring, reassuring her that he is still human at this point.\nThey arrive at the spacecraft, where it suddenly activates and its engines begin to melt the ice over it.\nKate falls into the ship and is separated from Carter.\nKate discovers the source of the radio transmission at the beginning of the film, in the form of a giant glowing cylinder with strange geometric blocks forming and shifting apart, the signal still broadcasting.\nConfronted by Sander, who has transformed into a larger creature, Kate destroys it with a thermite grenade and the explosion deactivates the ship, shutting down its engines.\nKate and Carter escape the ship and Carter suggests driving to a Soviet base about fifty miles away, saying that they'd stashed enough fuel in their snowcat to be just able to cover that distance.\nAs Kate and Carter return to their vehicle, Kate notices that Carter is missing his earring.\nShe tells him that she knew he was human earlier because he was still wearing the earring.\nUpon hearing this, Carter realizes that the earring is missing and points to his ear while attempting to explain its disappearance.\nWhen Carter points to the wrong ear, Kate realizes he must have been assimilated and proceeds to burn him.\nShe then retreats to Sander's snowcat and stares blankly as the screen fades black.\nAs the final credits roll, a helicopter pilot, Matias, arrives by morning at the now destroyed Norwegian outpost.\nHe shouts, looking for any survivors.\nColin is shown to have committed suicide in the radio room using a straight razor to slash both his arms and throat to ensure the Thing could never get to him.\nMatias sees the charred remains of the Adam/Edvard-Thing in the snow.\nLars, now revealed to be alive and uninfected, orders Matias at gunpoint to show his dental fillings to prove that he is a human.\nThe Thing, in the form of Lars' (deceased) dog, then runs out of the camp.\nLars realizes it's the Thing and orders Matias to start the helicopter.\nAs the dog flees, the two chase it in the Norwegian helicopter, with Matias piloting and Lars leaning out of the open doorway, trying to shoot it with a scoped rifle, thus leading into the events of the 1982 film.", "title": "The Thing (2011 film)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q909749"}}

By the time rescuers reach the miners, they find only comatose Harry Warden still alive. Further investigation reveals that Warden killed the other miners to conserve oxygen. Tom Hanniger, son of the mine's owner, is blamed for the explosion as he forgot to vent the methane lines that caused the collapse. One year later, Warden awakens from his coma and murders numerous patients and staff, leaving a victim's heart in a box of chocolates. While Tom, his girlfriend Sarah, their friends Irene and Axel, and other teenagers party inside the mine, Warden \u2013 wearing mining gear and a gas mask \u2013 attacks them with a pickaxe. Sarah, Irene, and Axel escape but Tom is left behind with Warden. Sheriff Burke arrives and shoots Warden before he can kill the severely traumatized Tom, but Warden staggers away deeper into the mine.\nTen years later, Tom returns to Harmony after his father dies. He is selling the mine, which angers mine manager Ben Foley. Axel, now the town's sheriff, has married Sarah but is having an affair with her coworker Megan. At the motel where Tom is staying, a masked assailant murders Irene and two other people. Camera footage from the scene reveals the killer dressed as a miner, starting rumors that Warden has returned. Axel receives a chocolate box containing Irene's heart. Meanwhile, Tom reconnects with Sarah and apologizes for his ten-year absence.\nLooking for Foley in the mine, Tom is locked inside a utility cage by the Miner, who murders the worker accompanying Tom and vanishes before help arrives. Tom insists that Warden has returned, but Axel reveals that Foley and Sheriff Burke found and killed Warden after his attack ten years ago. The group visits the woods where Warden's body was buried, but find that the grave is empty. Tom resolves to track down and stop Warden. Searching the woods, he finds the shack that Axel and Megan have been using for their affair. That night, the Miner kills Foley and leaves his body in Warden's grave. Axel realizes the killer must be one of the few people aware of the grave, and he becomes increasingly suspicious of Tom.\nThe Miner attacks Sarah and Megan, killing Megan just before Axel arrives. Sarah is hospitalized with minor wounds. The Miner then kills former sheriff Burke. Tom shows up at the hospital, telling Sarah he has to show her something he found in Axel's cabin. She checks herself out and accompanies Tom. As they drive, Tom suggests that Axel is the killer. Axel calls and urges Sarah to get away from Tom, whom he says is the killer; Axel has discovered that Tom spent the last seven years in a mental institution. Tom becomes increasingly agitated and Sarah, believing Axel, grabs the wheel and crashes the car before escaping into the woods.\nSarah hides in Axel's cabin. There she discovers evidence of Axel's affair and a tower of empty valentine gift boxes. The Miner appears and chases her into the mine. She is hiding in the mine when Axel arrives, and Sarah grabs his gun. Tom shows up, and Sarah holds the two men at gunpoint as they each accuse the other of being the killer. Tom, however, mentions the way Megan was killed, inadvertently revealing he is the killer. As Sarah points the gun at him, Tom hallucinates, revealing the Miner is his split personality. A flashback shows him digging up Warden's mining gear and committing the murders. After a struggle, Sarah shoots Tom, and the bullet strikes a fuel tank, which explodes. Sarah and Axel are rescued from the resulting cave-in. Tom also survives, murdering the rescue worker who finds him and escaping in the worker's gear.", "title": "My Bloody Valentine 3D", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q1137784"}}

General Fogarty orders Hendry to fly to Polar Expedition Six at the North Pole, per a request from its lead scientist, Nobel laureate Dr. Arthur Carrington (Robert Cornthwaite); Carrington has radioed that an unusual aircraft has crashed nearby. With Scott, Corporal Barnes, crew chief Bob, and a pack of sled dogs, Hendry pilots a Douglas C-47 transport aircraft to the remote outpost.\nUpon arrival, Scott and the airmen meet radio operator Tex, a woman named Mrs. Chapman, a man named Lee, who is one of two cooks, and the Inuit dog handlers. Also present are scientists Vorhees, Stern, Redding, Stone, Laurence, Wilson, Ambrose, Auerbach, Olson, Mrs. Chapman's husband Dr. Chapman, and Carrington. Hendry later rekindles his romance with Nikki Nicholson (Margaret Sheridan), Carrington's secretary. Several scientists fly with the airmen to the crash site, finding a large object buried beneath ice. As they spread out to determine its shape, they realize they are standing in a circle; they have discovered a flying saucer. The team attempts to melt the ice covering the saucer with thermite, but a violent reaction with the craft's metal alloy completely destroys it. Their Geiger counter, however, detects a frozen body buried nearby; it is excavated in a large block of ice and loaded aboard the transport. They fly out as an Arctic storm closes in on the site.\nHendry assumes command of the outpost and, pending instruction from General Fogarty, denies Scott permission to send out his story; he also denies the scientists' demands to examine the body. Tex sends an update to Fogarty, and the airmen settle in as the storm arrives. A watch is posted; Barnes relieves McPherson and, disturbed by the creature's appearance in the clearing ice, covers it with an electric blanket, which he does not realize is plugged in. The block slowly thaws and the creature, still alive, escapes into the storm and is attacked by the sled dogs. The airmen recover the creature's severed arm after the attack.\nThe scientists examine the arm, concluding that the alien is an advanced form of plant life. Carrington is convinced of its superiority to humans and becomes intent on communicating with it. The airmen begin a search, which leads to the outpost's greenhouse. Carrington stays behind with Vorhees, Stern, and Laurence, having noticed evidence of alien activity. They discover a third sled dog hidden away, which has had all of its blood drained; the carnivorous plant creature feeds on blood. Carrington and the scientists post a secret watch of their own, hoping to encounter the alien before the airmen find it.\nThe next morning, the airmen continue their search. Tex informs them that Fogarty is aware of their discovery and demands further information, now prevented by the fierce storm. Stern appears, badly injured, and tells the group that the creature has killed Auerbach and Olson. When the airmen investigate, the alien attacks them; they manage to barricade it inside the greenhouse. Hendry confronts Carrington and orders him to remain in his lab and quarters.\nCarrington, obsessed with the alien, shows Nicholson and the other scientists his experiment: using seeds taken from the severed arm, he has been growing small alien plants by feeding them from the blood plasma supply at the base. Hendry finds the plasma missing when it is needed to treat Stern, which leads him to Carrington. Fogarty transmits orders to keep the creature alive, but it escapes from the greenhouse and attacks the airmen in their quarters. They douse it with buckets of kerosene and set it afire, forcing it to retreat into the storm. After regrouping, they realize that their building's temperature is falling rapidly; the furnaces have stopped working, sabotaged by the alien. They retreat to the station's generator room to keep warm, and rig an electrical \"fly trap\". The alien continues to stalk them, but at the last moment, Carrington attempts to communicate, pleading with the creature. It knocks him aside, walks into the trap, and is electrocuted and reduced to a pile of ash.\nWhen the weather clears, Scotty is finally able to file his \"story of a lifetime\" by radio to a roomful of reporters in Anchorage.

He also detects the spirit of a 1930s singer named Sara Tidwell who plays records of her music. Sara also appears in dreams that Mike has of her last day alive in 1939. During his stay at the lake, Mike learns about \"Dark Score Crazy,\" an apparent form of madness that caused several men in the town to murder their daughters by drowning them.\nMax and his assistant attack Mike while he is in the lake. Afterwards, Max gives Mike an offer that he will stop the custody battle for Kyra if Mike agrees to leave them alone and not press charges. Mike agrees to it, and Max after that commits suicide.

Edgar confesses to Mike that Edgar, Mike's grandfather, and two other men assisted Max with the rape and murder of Sara Tidwell and the drowning of her daughter, Keisha.

{"id": "tt0335345", "text": "Depicts the final twelve hours in the life of Jesus of Nazareth, on the day of his crucifixion in Jerusalem.\n\nA depiction of the last twelve hours in the life of Jesus of Nazareth, on the day of his crucifixion in Jerusalem. The story opens in the Garden of Olives where Jesus has gone to pray after the Last Supper. Betrayed by Judas Iscariot, the controversial Jesus--who has performed 'miracles' and has publicly announced that he is 'the Son of God'--is arrested and taken back within the city walls of Jerusalem. There, the leaders of the Pharisees confront him with accusations of blasphemy; subsequently, his trial results with the leaders condemning him to his death. Jesus is brought before Pontius Pilate, the prefect of the Roman province of Judaea, for his sentencing. Pilate listens to the accusations leveled at Jesus by the Pharisees. Realizing that his own decision will cause him to become embroiled in a political conflict, Pilate defers to King Herod in deciding the matter of how to persecute Jesus. However, Herod returns Jesus to Pilate who, in turn, gives the crowd a choice between which prisoner they would rather to see set free--Jesus, or Barrabas. The crowd chooses to have Barrabas set free. Thus, Jesus is handed over to the Roman soldiers and is brutally flagellated. Bloody and unrecognizable, he is brought back before Pilate who, once again, presents him to the thirsty crowd--assuming they will see that Jesus has been punished enough. The crowd, however, is not satisfied. Thus, Pilate washes his hands of the entire dilemma, ordering his men to do as the crowd wishes. Whipped and weakened, Jesus is presented with the cross and is ordered to carry it through the streets of Jerusalem, all the way up to Golgotha. There, more corporal cruelty takes place as Jesus is nailed to the cross--suffering, he hangs there, left to die. Initially, in his dazed suffering, Jesus is alarmed that he has been abandoned by God his father. He then beseeches God. At the moment of his death, nature itself over-turns.::Anthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com}\n\nIn Jerusalem, against the backdrop of turmoil around the biblical 33 A.D., Jesus of Nazareth, a supposedly seditious local, is captured in the dead of night at the Garden of Gethsemane, after the betrayal of his disciple, Judas Iscariot. Tried by the Pharisees and turned over to the high priests and the angry mob after Pontius Pilate, the doubtful Roman governor, has washed his hands of the matter of Jesus' freedom, the Son of God has to carry His cross to Golgotha to be crucified. During His final twelve hours on earth, Christ endured extreme suffering, torture, and, ultimately, death in reparation for our sins, only to rise from the dead on the third day.::Nick Riganas\n\nMel Gibson's well-publicized production _The Passion of the Christ_ (qv) concerns the last 12 hours in the life of Jesus of Nazareth. The dialogue is spoken in the ancient Aramaic language, along with Latin and Hebrew. In the Garden of Gethsemane near the Mount of Olives, Jesus (James Caviezel) is betrayed by Judas Iscariot (Luca Lionello). Jesus is condemned to death for blasphemy and brought before Pontius Pilate (Hristo Naumov Shopov), the Roman governor of Judea, for sentencing. The roaring crowd demand his death, so Pilate orders his crucifixion. Jesus is severely beaten and made to carry his cross up to Golgotha, the hill outside Jerusalem, where he is nailed to the cross. Romanian theatrical actress Maia Morgenstern plays Mary, Mother of God, and Italian superstar Monica Bellucci plays Mary Magdalene.\n\nThe Passion of The Christ focusses on the last twelve hours of Jesus of Nazareth's life. The film begins in the Garden of Gethsemane where Jesus has gone to pray after sitting the Last Supper. Jesus must resist the temptations of Satan. Betrayed by Judas Iscariot, Jesus is then arrested and taken within the city walls of Jerusalem where leaders of the Pharisees confront him with accusations of blasphemy and his trial results in a condemnation to death.::Adam Ward\n\nThis film depicts the final hours of Jesus Christ, starting from His prayers in the Garden of Gethsemane and His betrayal at the hands of Judas Iscariot. It goes on to show the trials He endured under Pontius Pilate and King Herod as well as the torture and ridicule He suffered in between. Once the death sentence is pronounced, He carries a heavy wooden cross to Golgotha amidst throngs of jeering citizens and horrendous beatings, while a few citizens do what they can to help Him. Throughout this time, we are shown memories from His past with His mother and Disciples, where He gives His teachings. Finally, He is crucified, dies, and is buried, but resurrects from the dead on the third day.::Curly Q. Link", "title": "The Passion of the Christ", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q51668"}}

Han escapes and travels to America to investigate. There, his father and Triad boss Ch'u Sing is engaged in a joint business venture with Isaak O'Day, a black real estate developer and gang leader. The two have been acquiring properties along the waterfront to sell them to Vincent Roth, a businessman who plans to buy a new NFL franchise and build a stadium on the waterfront. Despite Ch'u's assurances that the deal is still in place, Isaak fears retribution following Po's death, and has his chief lieutenant Mac place security details on both of his children.\nMaking his way to Oakland, Han learns that his brother called Isaak's daughter Trish's record store the day before he was killed.

Longing to visit him, but unable to drive, Alvin develops a plan to travel to Mount Zion, Wisconsin on his riding lawnmower, towing a small homemade travel-trailer along the way. This stirs doubt and worry in the minds of his family, friends, and neighbors.\nAlvin's first attempt fails: after experiencing difficulty starting the old mower's motor, he does not get far before the machine breaks down. Alvin arranges for his mower to be transported back home on a flatbed truck, where he takes out his frustrations on the mower with a shotgun blast. At the John Deere dealership, he purchases a used lawn tractor whose transmission is still intact from 1966. The salesman offers Alvin kind words as his journey resumes.\nOn the side of the highway, Alvin passes a young female hitchhiker who later approaches his campfire and says that she could not get a ride. In conversation, Alvin deduces that she is pregnant and has run away from home. Alvin tells her about the importance of family by describing a bundle of sticks that is hard to break compared to a single stick. The next day, Alvin emerges from the trailer to find that she has left him a bundle of sticks tied together. Later, a huge group of RAGBRAI cyclists race past him. He arrives at the cyclists' camp and is greeted with applause. That night, he speaks with a pair of friendly cyclists around the campfire about growing old.\nThe next day, Alvin is troubled by massive trucks passing him. He then interacts with a distraught woman who has hit a deer and is being driven insane by the fact she continually hits deer while commuting, no matter how hard she tries to avoid them. She drives away in a tearful huff, and Alvin, who has started to run short on food, cooks and eats the deer. He mounts the antlers above the rear doorway of his trailer as a tribute to the deer and the sustenance it provided. Alvin's brakes fail as he travels down a steep hill; he struggles to maintain control of the speeding tractor and finally manages to bring the vehicle to a complete stop. A man named Danny helps Alvin get his mower and trailer off the main road.

Verlyn, an elderly war veteran, takes Alvin into town for a drink. Though Alvin does not drink alcohol, he orders a pint of milk, and the two men exchange traumatic stories about their experiences in World War II fighting against the Germans.\nAlvin's tractor is fixed, and he is presented with an exorbitant bill by the mechanics, who are twins and are constantly bickering. Alvin successfully negotiates the price down and explains his mission to help his brother. The twins seem to relate to Alvin's struggle. Alvin crosses the Mississippi River and makes camp in a cemetery. He chats with a Catholic priest who recognizes Lyle's name and is aware of his stroke.

Alvin responds that all he wants is to make peace with Lyle after their falling out ten years prior.\nFinally arriving in Mount Zion, Alvin stops at a bar to have a single beer: his first drink in years. He asks the bartender for directions to Lyle's house. Alvin experiences engine trouble just a few miles from Lyle's house and stops in the middle of the road. A large farm tractor driving by stops to help, then leads the way to make sure Alvin gets to his destination.\nWhen he arrives, Alvin finds the house dilapidated. He calls for his brother, who appears using a zimmer frame. Using two canes, Alvin makes his way to the door. Lyle invites Alvin to sit down on the porch. Lyle tearfully looks at Alvin's mower-tractor contraption and asks if Alvin had ridden it just to see him.

Piki explains that they are shamans who consume the flesh of the dead and coat themselves in ash to strengthen their bonds between the worlds of the living and the dead.\nThe next day Maria arrives at the temple and follows Piki's instructions. Inside, she uncovers a mummified corpse of a woman. Night falls and Oliver begins talking to Maria, who apologizes to Oliver for leaving him. Oliver starts pleading with Maria to open the door but she explains that she cannot do that. When Oliver says he has to leave Maria panics wanting more time and opens the door, but sees no one. She returns home the next day; now having closure, she focuses her attention on Michael and Lucy but doesn't tell Piki that she opened the door. Strange things start happening; their piano plays itself and Lucy tells Maria that Oliver has come back and that he is hiding from someone. Lucy also tells Maria that she should not let Michael know about Oliver's return until Oliver is ready to. In Oliver's room, a chair moves toward her, along with The Jungle Book, which Maria was reading to Oliver when he died, but never finished. Realising Oliver wants her to finish the book, she does so. Piki notices that the nearby plants have started dying and begins to realize that Maria had disobeyed her instructions at the temple.\nLater, the decomposed body of Oliver appears near Lucy. Maria discovers a bloody bite mark on her shoulder when giving Lucy a bath. Whereas Lucy was fond of Oliver's return in the past, she tells Maria that she no longer likes Oliver. She enters Oliver's room and tells him that he can't hurt Lucy. Oliver pulls out the chair and book again and Maria starts reading to him as long as he doesn't hurt Lucy. A shaman appears at the house and points behind Maria; she sees the mummified body from the temple behind her, which chases her. The next day, an outraged Piki confronts Maria and explains to her that due to her actions, Oliver's soul cannot be properly reincarnated and has become evil. She reveals to Maria that the strange figure she has been seeing is Myrtu, the gatekeeper of the underworld, who reclaims the soul of the dead. Piki urges Maria to burn all of Oliver's possessions to break his hold on the living world.\nWhile Piki attempts to discard and burn all of Oliver's remaining possessions, Oliver uses the guise of Piki's dead daughter to lure her to a pond and drown her. After Piki's funeral, Michael comes home and discovers Maria has finished burning Oliver's possessions. Distraught and angry, Michael does not believe Maria as she attempts to explain her actions. Reinforcing his mistrust, Lucy suddenly denies any knowledge of Oliver returning. Maria after realizes that Oliver has possessed Lucy. Michael believes that Maria is becoming mentally unhinged and locks her in a room.\nThe shamans begin to crowd the house; the possessed Lucy kills the Harwood\u2019s Golden Retriever Winston with a knife and stabs a horrified Michael. Maria breaks out and heads up to Oliver's room where she sees shamans chanting over Lucy's body. Since they cannot remove the spirit from Lucy, they plan to sacrifice her. However, Michael stops them and Maria tells Oliver that he needs to leave. Oliver says he is scared, but Maria says she will go with him. Oliver's spirit leaves Lucy's body and enters Maria's. She charges the shaman with the knife telling him to take her instead. He obliges, fatally stabbing her. She falls and awakens in the room alone. Myrtu appears and takes Maria to the afterlife.\nMaria then wakes up and briefly believes that she is alive. She hears Michael's voice call out for her. She sees the temple steps and realises Michael is attempting the same ritual to bring back Maria as she did with Oliver. Maria screams for him not to open the door, and the terror repeats itself again.", "title": "The Other Side of the Door (2016 film)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q21527930"}}

she then smashes the replica of Tony's head, thus restoring Tony's Pumaman powers.\nHe joins the fight with Vadinho and defeats all of the henchmen.\nKobras escapes through a trapdoor and to a helicopter.\nTony catches up to him, and with some deft aerial manoeuvring, manages to throw out the pilot and crash the chopper with Kobras inside.\nWith the world safe, Vadinho, Tony and Jane head to Stonehenge with the mask.\nVadinho summons the aliens with his amulet, and before joining them to return the mask to the Andes, he tells Tony to look for him when it is time to train his son to be the next Pumaman.\nThe film ends as Tony flies into the air with Jane and embraces her.", "title": "The Pumaman", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q1196312"}}

When she ventures outside to find her young son, Kevin, he claims that his teenaged sister, Ruby, has vanished.\nIn Washington, FBI Division Chief Scott Blevins informs Dana Scully that, unbeknownst to her, Fox Mulder has requested travel expenses to Sioux City based on a tabloid article about Ruby's disappearance. Blevins also shows Scully an X-File on the disappearance of Mulder's sister Samantha. When Scully asks Mulder about the travel expenses, he explains that Lake Okobogee was the scene of a series of UFO sightings in 1967; Darlene Morris, then a member of a Girl Scout troop, was one of the witnesses.\nWhen Mulder and Scully travel to Iowa and meet the Morrises, Mulder observes Kevin writing down binary code on a piece of paper; Kevin claims they are coming from static on a television screen. After submitting Kevin's code for analysis, the agents meet with the local sheriff, who tells them that Ruby was a juvenile delinquent who likely ran away. They also meet a young woman, Tessa, who says that Ruby had gotten pregnant and was planning to run away with her boyfriend, Greg Randall. The agents are unable to find Greg at the bar where he works; however, his boss tells them about UFO activity at Lake Okobogee.\nKevin's code is revealed to be part of a Defense Department satellite transmission. NSA agents ransack the Morris household, looking for any other documentation that might supposedly compromise national security. After the Morrises are taken into custody (which causes Darlene to lose her trust towards Mulder and Scully), Mulder examines the charred roof of their RV, prompting him to head to Lake Okobogee. There, the agents discover sand turned to glass and a burned tree line, indicating the presence of a massive heat source. Upon encountering some white wolves, Mulder and Scully find Greg Randall's body in a shallow grave.\nOn his person, they find a note in his wallet that eventually leads Mulder and Scully to conclude that it was Tessa, not Ruby, who was pregnant. Under interrogation, Tessa confesses to killing Greg but denies Ruby was at Lake Okobogee that night. The agents return to the Morris' house, and, finding it deserted, discover the binary-covered pieces of paper laid out across the living room floor, forming an image of Ruby's face.

They infiltrate Earth's ecosystem, latching onto plant life and taking the form of small pods with fragrant pink flowers. Elizabeth Driscoll, a laboratory scientist at the San Francisco Health Department, brings one of the flowers home, where she lives with her boyfriend Geoffrey. Leaving the flower on their bedside table, she awakens the next morning to discover Geoffrey now behaving strangely cold and distant.\nElizabeth's colleague, Matthew Bennell, advises her to visit his psychiatrist friend David Kibner, who is holding a book-signing party to promote his new self-help book. As Elizabeth and Matthew drive to the bookstore, a hysterical man warns them of danger and shouts \"They're coming! You'll be next!\" before being chased away by a mob of people and then hit by a car. The mob watch his death without any emotion. At the bookstore, Elizabeth asks Kibner for help regarding Geoffrey, but he theorizes that Elizabeth is simply using the belief that Geoffrey is behaving differently as an excuse to end their relationship. Despite other people complaining of similar scenarios, she takes his advice. Meanwhile, Matthew's friend Jack Bellicec calls Matthew to investigate when a grotesque body covered in fibres which resembles Jack is found in his wife Nancy's mud baths. Sensing danger with these odd occurrences, Matthew goes to Elizabeth to warn her. After breaking into her house, he finds Elizabeth in a deep sleep but also discovers a semi-formed duplicate of her in the bedroom. Suspecting Geoffrey's involvement, Matthew takes Elizabeth home with him, but when he returns later with the police, the duplicate body is gone.\nThe following night, Matthew and his friends are nearly duplicated as they sleep, by four pods in Matthew's garden. The aliens gestate inside the pods which grow to around three feet (about 1 m) in length before breaking open and spawning a human duplicate that grows rapidly. The pods duplicate any humans while they are sleeping in the immediate vicinity, copying not just their physical characteristics but their memories too. Once the duplication is complete, the original human dies and disintegrates and the alien \"pod person\" takes their place. Matthew calls the police, but realizes that the department has been infiltrated. They have also begun tracking him through the phone lines, alerting others to the group's location. Matthew destroys his own semi-formed duplicate before escaping with the others, pursued by the aliens who emit a shrill scream when they discover a human being among them, drawing other aliens nearby. Cornered at a dead end road, Jack and Nancy break away and create a distraction, allowing Matthew and Elizabeth to hide and eventually escape back into the city. There, the pair takes refuge in the health department, where they each ingest a large dose of speed, keeping them awake for several more hours. Again tracked through the phone lines, they are soon captured by Jack and Kibner, who have been duplicated. Matthew and Elizabeth are both injected with sedatives whilst being informed of the aliens' intentions for survivability, though their previous dose of Speed enables them to escape and kill Jack's duplicate whilst locking Kibner in a refrigerated room.\nMatthew and Elizabeth reunite with Nancy, who has learnt to evade the aliens by hiding her emotions and blending in with them. The two follow her example, but their cover is blown when Elizabeth screams at the sight of a mutant dog with a human head. They separate from Nancy amid the chaos and quickly board a truck en route to Pier 70, where the aliens are cultivating more pods and intending to ship them to other widely populated cities. While Matthew scouts the area in an attempt to flee aboard a vacant ship, Elizabeth falls asleep and is duplicated. Matthew returns and is horrified as her body disintegrates in his arms. Pursued by the duplicate Elizabeth, he breaks into the docks' warehouse and burns down the building, destroying hundreds of pods. He flees and hides under a bridge, exhausted, as the aliens try to find him.\n\nThe next morning, Matthew returns to work at the health department and witnesses several schoolchildren being taken for duplication, while more pods are being prepared for the remaining West Coast cities. As he heads towards City Hall, he encounters Nancy, who quietly approaches him and attempts a hushed conversation.

Natalie's relaxed, less rigid personality also does not fit with the rest of the patrons. Dutch also meets Natalie's snobbish, wealthy ex-husband Reed, who tells Natalie that he will have to break his Thanksgiving plans with their son Doyle for an unexpected business trip to London.\nNatalie calls Doyle at his private school in Georgia and invites him home for Thanksgiving, but Doyle refuses the offer, solely blaming his mother for the divorce. Despite this, Dutch sees an opportunity to get to know Doyle and further his relationship with Natalie, so he offers to go to Georgia and bring Doyle back to Chicago for the holidays.\nUpon arriving in Georgia, Dutch finds Doyle to be much like his father: snobbish, selfish and elitist. He welcomes Dutch by throwing a book at his face, hitting him with a golf club, kicking him and shooting him in the groin with a BB gun, for which Dutch promises revenge. Dutch ultimately hogties Doyle to a hockey stick and carries him to the car to start on the drive back home.\nThe trip entails several mishaps, including an impromptu fireworks show that sees Dutch's coat destroyed. Later, after Doyle throws a lit cigar in Dutch's lap, Dutch throws Doyle out of the car and makes him walk to the next motel by himself. Doyle gets even by parking Dutch's car in the middle of the highway, where it is hit and totaled by a truck. They hitch a ride with two prostitutes who steal their luggage and Dutch's wallet, leaving them stranded.\nDoyle calls his father, whom he discovers has lied about his trip to London; he instead spent the holidays with a girlfriend. Stunned by his father's betrayal, and wounded by Dutch's accusation that he \"hates his mother\", Doyle begins to regret his callous attitude. Dutch initially gives up and wants to call Natalie for assistance, but Doyle refuses and insists on getting home on their own.

One night, two spree killers attempt to rob the restaurant. When a waitress is threatened, Tom deftly kills both robbers with surprising skill and precision. He is hailed as a hero by his family and the townspeople, and the incident makes him a local celebrity. Tom is visited by scarred gangster Carl Fogarty, who alleges that Tom is actually a Philadelphia professional hitman named Joey Cusack who had dealings with him in the Irish Mob in Philadelphia. Tom vehemently denies this, but Carl remains persistent and begins to stalk the Stall family. Under pressure from Carl and his newfound fame, Tom's relationships with his family become strained.\nFollowing an argument with his father over the use of violence on a bully at his school, Jack runs away. He is caught by Carl, who, with Jack as his hostage, goes with his men to the Stall house and demands that \"Joey\" return to Philadelphia with them. After the gangsters release Jack, Tom is slow to join them in their car, so they attempt to force him to cooperate. Tom kills the two henchmen with the same precision he used against the robbers, but Carl shoots Tom before he can do the same to him. As the gangster stands over Tom, preparing to kill him, Tom finally drops the fa\u00e7ade and admits he is indeed Joey. However, before Carl can deliver a coup de gr\u00e2ce, Jack kills him with a shotgun.\nAt the hospital, Edie confronts Tom, claiming that while he was attacking Carl's men, she saw \"the real Joey\" that the gangster was talking about. Tom shocks Edie by admitting that he is actually Joey Cusack, and that he has killed for both money and pleasure. He tells Edie that he ran away from Philadelphia to escape his violent criminal past. This admission deepens the tensions in their marriage.\nAfter Tom gets out of the hospital, Sam, the local sheriff, pays a visit. Sam expresses confusion about everything that has happened. He tells Tom and Edie that these mobsters would never go to so much trouble unless they were certain that they had the right man. Just when Tom is about to confess, Edie lies to Sam, claiming that Tom is who he says he is, and that their family has suffered enough. At a loss for words after Edie breaks down into tears, Sam leaves. Edie and Tom then start slapping and hitting each other, their fight eventually culminating in violent sex on the stairs. Afterward, Edie and Jack continue to further distance themselves from Tom, leaving him isolated. He receives a call from his brother Richie Cusack, who also demands his return to Philadelphia, or else he will come to Indiana to find him. After traveling to meet his brother, Tom learns that the other mobsters whom he had offended in Philadelphia took out their frustrations on Richie, penalizing him financially and delaying his advancement in the organization. Tom offers to make peace, but Richie orders his men to kill his brother. Tom manages to kill most of the guards and escape. As Richie and his last henchman are hunting for him, Tom kills the henchman, takes his gun, and confronts Richie outside; stunned, Richie says \"Jesus, Joey\" before Tom kills him with a single gunshot to the head, responding \"Jesus, Richie\".\nTom returns home, where the atmosphere is tense and silent as the family sits around the dinner table.

His proud father, Lord Canterville (Reginald Owen), refuses to acknowledge that his son has disgraced the family name, even when shown in front of witnesses where Simon is cowering. The father has the only entrance to his son's hiding place bricked over as proof that Simon is not there, ignoring Simon's pleas for mercy. Lord Canterville then curses his doomed cowardly son to find no rest until \"a kinsman shall perform an act of bravery\" in his name, wearing his signet ring.\nNext, during World War II, US Army Rangers are billeted in the castle, owned now by six-year-old Lady Jessica de Canterville (Margaret O'Brien).

On a mission in Europe, he and another soldier are stationed with a machine gun to ambush a large group of Nazi soldiers on motorcycles. Sir Simon appears with the signet ring, which Cuffy had left behind, and his attempts to encourage Cuffy make the young man even more apprehensive. The Nazi convoy appears on the road.

Another soldier knocks him aside and takes over.\nBack in England, Cuffy reports himself.

The power line lands in wet mud and electrifies the worms underneath. The next morning, Geri Sanders borrows a truck from her neighbor, worm farmer Roger Grimes, to pick up her boyfriend Mick, who is arriving from New York City for a vacation.  While Geri and Mick go to town, Roger's shipment of 100,000 bloodworms and sandworms escape from the back of the truck. Mick enters a diner, where a customer says over 300,000 volts are being released into the ground from severed power lines. He orders an egg cream and finds a worm in it, though the owner and Sheriff Jim Reston believe he is joking.\nGeri introduces Mick to her mother Naomi and sister Alma, before they both leave to browse at antique dealer Aaron Beardsley's house. Outside, Roger's father Willie finds the shipment of worms is missing. Roger sees Mick with Geri and becomes envious of their relationship. After arriving at Beardsley's house, Geri and Mick cannot find him, but Geri sees a human skeleton outside the property. They bring over Sheriff Reston but the skeleton disappears. Thinking it is another prank, Reston threatens to arrest Mick if he returns to the town. While asking locals about Beardsley's whereabouts, they find out he was last seen before the storm. Mick believes he himself unintentionally released the worms; he apologizes to Roger and invites him to go fishing with him and Geri. They find the skeleton in Roger's truck.\nWhile on the boat, Mick is bitten by a worm. Roger shows his bitten-off thumb and tells Mick and Geri that worms attack when electrified. Mick gets off the boat to tend to his wound, leaving Geri with Roger; Mick and Alma take the skeleton's skull to an abandoned dental office, where they compare its teeth with X-rays and confirm the skeleton is Beardsley's. Roger makes advances towards Geri, but the worms they brought as bait attack him and crawl into his face. He runs off into the woods and Geri tells Mick what happened. Mick and Geri visit the worm farm to find Roger, but Mick finds Willie's body being eaten by worms. They try telling Sheriff Reston, but he ignores them. Mick deduces the worms killed Beardsley but cannot figure out why they attacked him.\nWhile Mick and Geri are eating dinner with Naomi and Alma, the worms eat through the roots of a tree, causing it to crash into the house. Mick realizes electricity is still being released from the power lines and that the wet soil is acting as a conductor; he hypothesizes the worms only come out at night. Mick tells Geri to keep everyone inside equipped with candles and leaves to get plywood to board up the house. Roger, whose face has been deformed by worms, attacks Mick and knocks him unconscious. Roger enters the house and kidnaps Geri. The worms infest the house and attack other places in town. Sheriff Reston and a woman are eaten alive in a jail cell, and people at a bar are attacked and eaten.\nMick regains consciousness and finds Naomi's remains, covered in worms, at the house. When he goes upstairs, Roger attacks and chases him downstairs. Mick pushes Roger into a pile of worms, which engulf him. Mick frees Geri and tells her that Naomi, and presumably Alma, are dead. While they try escaping through a window, Roger crawls out of the pile of worms and bites Mick in the leg. Mick beats Roger to death with a flashlight before climbing onto a tree with Geri, where they stay until morning.

Believing that she is now seeing Victor the meat cutter, he vindictively blocks her driveway with snow every night. Tommy is cheating on his girlfriend Sharon with his married high school sweetheart Darian.\nWillie meets 13 year-old neighbor girl Marty, and they strike up a witty rapport. She presses him about his relationship: Willie has been with his girlfriend Tracy for a year, but is unsure if he wants to marry her. He is considering taking a steady job as a salesman, but Mo urges him not to quit his music. Paul desperately proposes to Jan, but she turns him down. Sharon argues with Tommy about his infidelity, and seeks advice from her girlfriends. The outspoken Gina advises her to break up with Tommy, but Sharon tries to salvage the relationship by planning him a surprise birthday party. When the attractive Andera comes to town from Chicago, the guys compete for her attention. The next day, Gina lectures Willie and Tommy about men's unrealistic expectations of women set by supermodels and pornography. Willie feels jealous when he sees that Marty has a boyfriend.\nDarian shows up at Tommy's surprise party drunk and openly tries to seduce him, causing Sharon to leave heartbroken. Tommy drives Darian home but refuses her advances, and unsuccessfully tries to patch things up with Sharon. Willie tells Mo about his feelings for Marty, but Mo reminds him how young she is and says that Willie just doesn't want to grow up. Willie again encounters Marty, who says that she has broken up with her boyfriend because she is interested in Willie, and asks him to wait five years until she is 18 and they can be together. Willie declines, saying that she will outgrow her feelings for him as she matures.\nPaul takes Andera out in an attempt to make Jan jealous. Andera plays along, but when Paul tries to kiss her she smacks him and leaves. Willie chastises Paul about his obsession with supermodels; Paul responds that beautiful girls represent hope and promise. Tommy breaks things off with Darian, but she states her intent to win him back at the reunion. Andera approaches Willie, turning down his flirtations but accompanying him to Paul's ice shanty, where they discuss their respective relationships. Willie misses the emotional rush of new love, but Andera feels truly happy with her boyfriend and returns to Chicago the next day. Tracy arrives from New York, and Willie's feelings for her are rekindled. Marty is downhearted by this, but Willie assures her that she will grow up to do amazing things.\nAt the reunion, Darian is confronted by a former classmate who she bullied; he tells her that she was beautiful, but \"mean as a snake\". Tommy skips the reunion to avoid Darian, but encounters her husband Steve and his friends at a bar. Steve reveals that he knows about the affair; a fight ensues, and Tommy is badly beaten. Learning of this, the guys rush to Steve's house to confront him. Steve calls his friends, but Willie pushes their car into a snowbank using Paul's snowplow. Mo is about to beat Steve but stops himself when Steve's daughter comes to the door. Darian arrives home in the aftermath of the confrontation. Tommy ends up in the hospital with a concussion and two broken ribs. Sharon stays with him overnight, and they make up. Paul, overcome with emotion, clears Jan's driveway of snow.\nWillie says his goodbyes the next day, having decided to head back to New York with Tracy and not to take the sales job. Paul announces that Jan and Victor are engaged. Willie introduces Tracy to Marty, and kisses Marty on the cheek before departing.", "title": "Beautiful Girls (film)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q813451"}}

Seth's main responsibility is to appear to those who are close to death and guide them to the next life. During this task, Seth and one of his fellow angels, Cassiel, enjoy asking people what their favorite thing in life was. Despite these daily encounters, they have trouble understanding human beings and their ways, as angels lack human senses.\nWhile waiting to escort a man undergoing heart surgery to the other world, Seth is impressed by the vigorous efforts of the surgeon, Maggie Rice, to save the ill-fated man's life and her sincere anguish at her failure to do so. Seth soon becomes preoccupied with Maggie and decides to become visible to her. They develop a friendship which soon turns to mutual attraction, although Maggie is already involved with one of her colleagues, Jordan Ferris. Seth then meets Nathaniel Messinger, one of Maggie's patients, who can sense Seth's presence and that of other angels. Nathaniel relates to Seth that he, too, had  once been an angel but, by way of the free will granted equally to mortals and angels, decided to become human through the process he refers to as \"falling\". Seth begins to consider exercising this option so that he can be with Maggie, and she learns he is an angel.\n\nSeth decides to become human through the symbolic gesture of jumping from the top of a skyscraper. Immediately upon awakening, he starts to experience all of the human feelings and sensations that he had never been able to understand, beginning with physical injury and pain. Now human, Seth heads to the hospital to see Maggie, but is told that she has gone to her uncle's mountain cabin for a break.\nPenniless and na\u00efve, he cannot pay for the journey and ends up getting mugged. He eventually hitches a ride to Lake Tahoe and appears, soaked and cold, at Maggie's doorstep. Maggie realizes that he has given up his angelic status for her love, and they have sex. The next morning, as Seth is in the shower, Maggie rides her bicycle to a local store. On her way back, happy and fulfilled, she rides her bicycle with her eyes closed and her arms wide open. Her happiness is cut when she fails to notice a logging truck that was backing up in her path and is killed in the collision.\nSeth senses that Maggie is in trouble and runs to her aid. He arrives in time for Maggie to tell him that she sees the angel who has come to escort her away. Although Seth is no longer able to see the angels, he knows they are there and frantically begs Maggie not to look at them. Maggie tells him that she is not afraid anymore and that when they will ask her what her favorite thing in life used to be, she will say it was Seth, before she dies.\nGrieving and alone, Seth is visited by Cassiel. Seth questions if he is being punished for leaving heaven to be a human, which Cassiel assures him is not the case. Sometime later, Seth expresses his joy in being human and the fact that he has come to terms with his new life by running into the ocean and feeling the waves.", "title": "City of Angels (film)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q168010"}}

Other episodes with recognizable settings are set outside the United States, include Mexico and London, U.K.. Another notable feature of this future Earth is that the Moon was broken in two pieces. The shattered moon and the ruins of the former human civilization were caused by the passage of a runaway planet between the Earth and the Moon in 1994, which, from scenes shown in the opening sequence, caused radical changes in the Earth's climate and geography. However, by the time period in which the series is set, the Earth and Moon seem to have settled into a new physical balance. Earth is reborn as \"New Earth\", a world of \"savagery, super-science, and sorcery\" far more chaotic than \"Old Earth\" (the show's name for the preapocalyptic world).\nThe hero Thundarr (voiced by Robert Ridgely), a muscular warrior, whose companions include Princess Ariel, a formidable young sorceress, and Ookla the Mok, travel the world on horseback, battling mostly evil wizards who combine magical spells with reanimating technologies from the pre-catastrophe world. Some of these malevolent wizards enlist the service of certain mutant species to do their bidding.\nOther enemies include The Brotherhood of Night (a group of werewolves who could transform others into werewolves by their touch), the cosmic Stalker from The Stars (a predatory, malevolent cosmic vampire), and various other mutants. Intelligent humanoid-animal races include the rat-like Groundlings, the crocodile-like Carocs, and talking hawk- and pig-like mutants. New animals that existed include fire-shooting whales, a giant green snake with a grizzly bear's head, and mutated dragonflies and rabbits.\nThundarr's weapon of choice, the Sunsword, projects a blade-like beam of energy when activated, and can be deactivated so that it is only a hilt. The Sunsword's energy blade can deflect other energy attacks as well as magical ones, can cut through nearly anything, and can disrupt magical spells and effects. The Sunsword is magically linked to Thundarr and as such, only he can use it; however, this link can be disrupted.Comic book writer-artist Jack Kirby worked on the production design for the show. The main characters were designed by fellow comic book writer-artist Alex Toth. Toth, however, was unavailable to continue working on the show, so most of the wizards and other villains and secondary characters that appear on the show were designed by Kirby. He was brought onto the show at the recommendation of comic writer Steve Gerber and Mark Evanier.The series was the creation of Steve Gerber. Gerber and friend Martin Pasko were having dinner in the Westwood area one night during the time Gerber was developing the series. Gerber commented to Pasko that he had not yet decided upon a name for the wookiee-like character the network insisted be added to the series, over Gerber's objections. As the two walked past the gate to the UCLA campus, Pasko quipped, \"Why not call him Oo-clah?\" Pasko later became one of several screenwriters also known for their work in comics, such as Roy Thomas and Gerry Conway, to contribute to the show. After writing several scripts, singly and in collaboration with Gerber, Pasko became a story editor on the second season.

One night he receives a call about a client who was involved in a hit-and-run accident, leaving his high-stakes poker game to attend to the matter. Later he drives into the countryside and in the early morning he suddenly stops to approach a trio of horses in a field, when a bomb detonates in his car parked nearby.\nFour days earlier, Arthur Edens, one of the firm's leading attorneys, has a manic episode in the middle of a deposition in Milwaukee involving a multibillion-dollar, six-year-long class action lawsuit against client U-North, an agricultural products conglomerate. Michael arrives in Milwaukee and bails Arthur out of jail after finding out he is no longer taking his medication, but Arthur escapes from their hotel room in the middle of the night and returns to New York. Meanwhile, Michael is $75,000 in debt from an investment he entered with his brother Timmy, which collapsed when Timmy used the restaurant's funds to feed his drug addiction. Michael, having gone to a loan shark to raise the money, is held responsible for the debt and given one week to come up with the money. Michael asks his boss Marty Bach for a loan to cover the expenses; Marty insinuates that the firm will be finished if Michael doesn't get Arthur under control.\nKaren Crowder, U-North's general counsel, discovers that Arthur had come into possession of a confidential U-North document, a 1991 memo proving the company knew their brand weed killer was carcinogenic, which led to 468 deaths and the class-action lawsuit. Karen brings this to the attention of U-North's CEO Don Jeffries, whose signature is on the memo. Don puts her in contact with two hitmen secretly held on retainer. She contracts them to follow Arthur and bug his apartment and phone. Michael finds Arthur on a Manhattan street and confronts him about calls he made to Anna Kaiserson, one of the plaintiffs in the U-North suit. Arthur realizes that his calls are being monitored. Arthur calls his own voicemail at the firm and reads from the 1991 memo, and says he will go public with it and ruin U-North. When the hitmen tell Karen that Arthur is building a case to expose U-North, she approves of their taking \"drastic measures.\" They break into Arthur's apartment, kill him, and make it look like a suicide.\nAfter learning of Arthur's death, Michael becomes suspicious when he discovers that U-North was planning a settlement just a few days before, and that Arthur had booked a flight to New York for Anna. He finds Anna and learns that no one knew of her conversations with Arthur, not even her attorney, yet Michael's firm knew of Arthur's conversations with the U-North plaintiffs. Michael breaks into Arthur's sealed apartment with the plan to reseal it with a police seal obtained from his brother Gene, a police officer. He finds a bottle of champagne and two glasses in the refrigerator and suspects Arthur arranged to have Anna come to his apartment. There is also a copy of a fantasy novel beloved by Michael's son Henry, with several pages highlighted and annotated by Arthur. A receipt from a photocopy shop was being used as a bookmark.\nThe hitmen, who have been trailing Michael, call the police as he enters the apartment. Michael is caught and arrested for trespassing, but Gene bails him out. Using the receipt, Michael discovers that Arthur had ordered 3,000 copies of the confidential U-North document. Michael takes one copy of the document with him. The hitmen also obtain a copy, which they provide to Karen. Believing Michael is blackmailing the firm, Marty offers him a renewed contract and the $80,000 he had requested, on the condition he signs a non-disclosure agreement. Michael realizes that Marty and Barry know about U-North's cover-up. After paying Timmy's debt, he goes to a poker game.\nOne of the assassins rigs Michael's car with a bomb, but is forced to leave the job unfinished when Michael suddenly abandons his poker game after receiving a phone call summoning him to meet the hit-and-run client. The assassins detonate the radio-controlled bomb. When the bomb explodes, Michael runs back to his burning car, throws some of his personal effects into it, and escapes into the woods. \nLater, at a U-North board meeting at the New York Hilton Midtown hotel, Karen proposes that the board approve a new settlement in the lawsuit. She is shocked when Michael confronts her in the foyer, since she believed him to be dead. He informs her that he has the memo, and knows about her role in Arthur's murder and the subsequent attempt on his own life. He goads Karen into offering him $10 million for his silence.

Patrick Kenzie and his partner and girlfriend Angie Gennaro witness a televised plea for Amanda's return by her mother, Helene, amid a media frenzy. The girl's aunt Bea and uncle Lionel hire them to find Amanda.\nUsing his connections in the Boston crime underground, Patrick discovers that Helene and her boyfriend \"Skinny Ray\" were drug mules for a local Haitian drug lord named Cheese, and had recently stolen $130,000 from him. After discovering Ray has been murdered by Cheese's men, Patrick and Angie join detectives Remy Bressant and his partner Nick Poole in investigating the case. They believe that Cheese may have taken Amanda. Helene tearfully makes Patrick promise to her that he will bring Amanda home alive.\nPatrick meets with Cheese and tries to negotiate the return of Cheese's stolen money in exchange for Amanda, but Cheese initially denies any involvement in the girl's disappearance. Police Captain Jack Doyle later reads Patrick a telephone transcript of Cheese calling into the station to set up an exchange for Amanda. The exchange at a nearby quarry is botched after a gunfight breaks out, and Cheese is killed. It is believed that Amanda fell in the quarry's pond and drowned; her doll is retrieved from the water and returned to Helene. Doyle, whose own daughter was killed years before, goes into early retirement following public outcry over the mishap.\nTwo months later, a seven-year-old boy is abducted in Everett, and Patrick receives information that he was taken by Corwin Earle, a known child molester, who is living with two married career criminals and cocaine addicts. After entering the addicts' house and finding evidence of the abducted boy, Patrick returns with Remy and Nick late at night to rescue him. Before they enter the house, the addicted woman shoots her husband dead and then fatally wounds Nick before chasing Patrick into Corwin's room, where he finds the dead child; enraged, he kills Corwin as Remy arrives and kills the woman with a shotgun. Meeting the next night outside, Remy, half-drunk but trying to alleviate Patrick's guilt over the killing, confides that he once planted evidence on an abusive husband to help the man's wife and son escape, with the help of \"Skinny Ray.\" Patrick later remembers that Remy had first told him he didn't know Ray.\nNick dies of his injuries. After his funeral, Patrick speaks to a police officer named Devin. He tells Devin that Remy lied to him about knowing Skinny Ray and something big must be going on. Devin tells him that Remy, who came up from the Louisiana police force years ago with Doyle, had known about Cheese's stolen money before Cheese even knew it was missing. Patrick goads Lionel into meeting him in a bar and pieces together that Lionel and Remy had conspired to stage a fake kidnapping in order to take the drug money for themselves and to teach Helene a lesson, which Lionel finally admits. At that point, Remy (trying to cover for his earlier mistake) enters the bar wearing a mask, staging a robbery to interrupt their conversation. Patrick realizes that Remy plans to kill him and Lionel to keep them quiet and \"announces\" loudly to the bar that Remy kidnapped Amanda. Remy hesitates and the bartender shoots him twice in the back. Remy flees, pursued by Patrick to the rooftop of a nearby building, where he dies from his wounds. \nPatrick is questioned by the police about Remy's death and learns that the police never had a phone transcript like the one that Doyle had read to him prior to the botched exchange. Patrick then realizes Doyle is probably part of this. He and Angie then drive to Doyle's home, where they find Amanda alive and well and Doyle about to leave. Doyle admits he was part of the kidnapping all along and helped set up the fake exchange to frame Cheese and throw Patrick off the scent. Patrick threatens to call the authorities, but Doyle tries to convince him that Amanda is better off living with him than with her neglectful mother and to do the right thing. Patrick discusses the choice with Angie; she believes Amanda is happy and safe with Doyle, and says she will hate Patrick if he returns Amanda to her mother. \nThe police are then seen driving up to Doyle's house; Patrick decided to call the police to collect Amanda, as he cannot bring himself to break his promise to Helene and believes she belongs with her mother, regardless of Helene's parenting. Doyle and Lionel are arrested, and Patrick and Angie break up.\nPatrick later visits Helene and Amanda as Helene is about to leave for a date. She and the place look better taken care of, giving the impression that she is at least trying to clean up her act. However, she hadn't made plans for a babysitter, so Patrick volunteers to watch her. Patrick asks Amanda about her doll Mirabelle, only to have Amanda inform him that her doll's name is Annabelle, implying that Helene did not even know the name of her daughter's favorite toy and that this may not end happily ever after.", "title": "Gone Baby Gone", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q247182"}}

in the tense escape operation, a Christmas elf aboard the S-1 inadvertently leans on a button, causing a present to fall from the supply line and go unnoticed.\nHaving completed his 70th mission, Malcolm is portrayed as far past his prime and whose role in field operations now is largely symbolic.\nNonetheless, he is held in high esteem, and delivers a congratulatory speech to the enraptured elves.\nMalcolm announces he looks forward to his 71st, much to the frustration of heir-apparent Steve, who had prepared to succeed his father as Santa at the conclusion of this mission.\nDuring their family Christmas dinner, Arthur's suggestion for the family to play a board game degenerates into a tense quarrel between Malcolm and Steve, while Malcolm's father and predecessor Grandsanta, bored by retirement, resentfully criticises their over-modernization.\nAfter Grandsanta knocks the board off the table, Steve's PDA (a high tech device named a 'HOHO') flashes and he leaves the table in a hurry.\nLater, their father shares with his wife Margaret his grave doubts about his self-identity should he retire.\nArthur follows Steve, and the two learn that a Christmas elf named Bryony found the missed present - a wrapped bicycle for a little girl in England called Gwen, to whose letter Arthur had personally responded.\nArthur alerts his father, who is at a loss as to how to handle the situation;

furthermore a US Predator drone scrambled by Chief De Silva of UNFITA intercepts and opens fire on the sleigh believing them to be aliens.\nGrandsanta sacrifices the sleigh, while Arthur and Bryony to parachute to the ground.\nUltimately with Margaret and Bryony's help, all the male Clauses arrive at Gwen's house before she awakens, only to have all but Arthur quarrel about who gets to actually place the gift.\nNoticing that only Arthur truly cares about the girl's feelings, the elder Clauses collectively realize that he is the sole worthy successor.\nAs a result, Malcolm gives Arthur the honour and Steve, recognizing his own shortcomings, forfeits his supposed birthright and acknowledges his brother's worthiness to take up the mantle.\nIn a fitting conclusion, Gwen glimpses a snow-bearded Arthur in a wind-buffeted sweater just before he vanishes up into the S-1.\nWith the crisis resolved, Malcolm goes into a happy retirement with Margaret;

She and Peter spend time together, and Saul persuades Peter to propose to her \"again\"; she accepts, even though she is in love with Jack. When Jack visits her the day before the wedding, she gives him a chance to change her mind, asking him if he can give her a reason not to marry Peter. He replies that he cannot, leaving her disappointed.\nOn the day of the wedding, just as a priest begins the ceremony, Lucy finally confesses everything and tells the family she loves Jack rather than Peter. At this point, Peter's real fianc\u00e9e Ashley Bartlett Bacon (Ally Walker), who happens to be married herself, arrives and also demands the wedding be stopped. As the family argues, Lucy slips out unnoticed, unsure of her future.\nSome time later, while Lucy is at work, Jack places an engagement ring in the token tray of her booth. She lets him into the booth (after he pays his fare), and with the entire Callaghan family watching, he proposes to her. In the last scenes of the film, they kiss at the end of their wedding, then leave on a CTA train for their honeymoon. She narrates that he fulfilled her dream of going to Florence, Italy, and explains that, when Peter asked when she fell in love with Jack, she replied, \"it was while you were sleeping.\"", "title": "While You Were Sleeping (film)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q492093"}}
{"id": "tt0190374", "text": "The Empire of Izmir has long been a divided land, ruled by the Mages, an elite group of powerful warlocks. In the capital of Sumdall, an evil mage named Profion creates a magical sceptre that can allow him to control Gold dragons, but his attempt to control an individual fails, and he is forced to kill it. As he begins to make new plans, the dragon bleeds into the nearby river, causing it to catch fire, which many inhabitants of Sumdall notice, including a pair of teenage thieves, Ridley and his best friend Snails.\nLater, Profion and the Council of Mages discuss the controversial views of Empress Savina, who wants to give rights to non-mages in Izmir. When the Council threatens to confiscate from her the scepter that allows her to control Gold dragons, she decides to seek the Rod of Savrille, which has the power to control Red dragons. Profion learns of this and decides to take the Rod himself. Meanwhile, Ridley and Snails break into the Sumdall magic school to steal whatever items they can to become rich, but are discovered by a young Mage named Marina. She is distracted when the library wizard is held hostage and interrogated by Profion's assistant Damodar for information on the map to the Rod. After the wizard refuses to talk and sends the map over to Marina, Damodar kills him, and Marina travels through a portal to escape, unintentionally taking the thieves with her. After crashing into a pile of garbage, they meet a dwarf named Elwood, who ends up joining the three's escape through the sewers.\nDamodar puts a price on Marina, Ridley, Snails and Elwood's heads and after letting Profion know that the group got away with the map, Profion creates a tentacled monster inside Damodar which painfully possesses him. The group hide inside of a tavern and read the map that Ridley and Marina get sucked into. Damodar and his minions attack Elwood and Snails, but they escape with the map. Ridley and Marina exit the map and all decide to work together to find the Rod. They must first find a ruby called the \"Eye of the Dragon\" that can open the door to a tomb containing the sceptre. The Eye is held by the thieves' guild in the city of Antius, whose leader, Xilus, reveals it to be in a maze puzzle of traps, and promises to give the group the \"Eye of the Dragon\" if Ridley successfully solves it, which he does. Damodar suddenly arrives to capture him and his friends. Marina is captured instead while Ridley, Snails and Elwood escape with the \"Eye of the Dragon\", meeting an elf named Norda who works for Empress Savina, whom she thus informs about Profion's plans upon hearing them from Ridley. In his castle, Damodar interrogates Marina and uses the tentacles in his mind to gain her knowledge.\nRidley and Snails break into Damodar's castle to rescue Marina, while Norda and Elwood stay behind. After Ridley and Snails decide to split up, Ridley finds and rescues Marina, but Snails is confronted by Damodar after he finds the map and a fight ensues between the two with Damodar gaining the upper hand. When Ridley and Marina arrive, Snails throws the map to his comrades, but at the cost of his own life as he is killed by Damodar before being thrown off the castle. Ridley, infuriated and filled with rage, attacks Damodar to avenge his friend, but he disarms him and stabs Ridley with his own sword. In the confusion, Marina grabs some magic dust and creates a magic portal to escape with Ridley. Meanwhile, during a Council meeting, Profion and Savina's factions decide to battle for control of Izmir using magic.\nAt the same time, an elf heals Ridley along with Norda's soldiers. Later, Marina finds Ridley and tries to help him get over the death of Snails, but Ridley, still feeling remorseful of his friend's death, angrily scolds her for letting Snails die instead of saving him. After a brief argument between the two in which Marina convinces Ridley that Snails' death was not in vain, they eventually forgive each other and become love interests. Ridley later uses the \"Eye of the Dragon\" to enter the tomb that contains the Rod. It is held by a skeleton that comes to life and tells Ridley he is Savrille, now cursed for trying to control red dragons, and \"Anyone who wields the power of the Rod shall suffer a horrible fate\", but Damodar arrives to steal the Rod.\nDamodar returns to Sumdall with the Rod, where the Empress and her Gold dragons are battling the Mages following Profion below, to bring it to Profion, but Ridley and his friends follow in pursuit. Profion removes the monster from Damodar and uses the Rod to summon Red dragons, which battle the Gold dragons and slowly begin to win the fight. Ridley comes across Damodar, duels him with his new magic sword and then successfully wounds the latter before finishing him off by hurling Damodar off the castle wall to his death, finally avenging Snails. He then attacks Profion, who disarms him and shoves him back. Ridley's companions arrive and fight Profion one at a time. Ridley picks up the fallen Rod, and uses it to stop the red dragons. Marina encourages Ridley to use the Rod to bring Profion down, but Ridley, realizing the Rod's power will corrupt him, refuses and destroys it. Empress Savina arrives and condemns Profion, who fights her with powerful magic, but she summons a Gold dragon which devours Profion, ending the battle and Profion's reign of terror.\nRidley later visits Snails' grave with Norda, Marina and Elwood and pays tribute to his fallen comrade. When he places the \"Eye of the Dragon\" on the grave, Snails' name disappears, and Norda tells Ridley not to question his abilities. Norda then uses the \"Eye of the Dragon\" to transport Ridley to another place in the world where his friend would await for him, along with herself, Marina and Elwood.", "title": "Dungeons & Dragons (2000 film)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q1265779"}}

{"id": "tt0238552", "text": "William Foster and Ed Whittle are biomedical research scientists working for Bionyne Corporation in Puerto Rico, attempting to transfer the mind of a dead soldier into an android with superhuman strength, codenamed Subject 345. Foster specializes in synthetic biology and mapping of the mind's neural pathways, while Whittle's speciality is reproductive human cloning. Foster successfully captures the soldier's neural map and transfers it into the android's synthetic brain, but the experiment fails when the soldier recoils in horror at the android body and destroys it, killing himself again. Foster's boss Jones warns him that if he cannot get Subject 345 to work, the company's shareholders will shut the project down.\nFoster takes his wife Mona and three children Sophie, Matt, and Zoe, on a boating trip, but on the way all but William are killed in a car crash. Determined to resurrect his family, he coaxes Ed to bring him the Bionyne equipment necessary to extract his family's neural maps and to clone replacement bodies for them. He successfully extracts their neural maps and tells Whittle to dispose of the bodies, but the first major obstacle to his plan presents itself: only three cloning pods are available, forcing him to choose one to sacrifice. He chooses Zoe, the youngest, and erases her memory from the neural maps of the other three. Whittle starts the seventeen-day cycle required to create mature replacement clones for Foster's family, and tells him he has only that long to solve the problem of integrating the neural maps into the cloned bodies, or else they will start to deteriorate by aging at an abnormally fast rate. Integrating the mind into a biological clone was phase two of the research project, to be solved after android transfer. Foster is forced to keep this secret, since he and Whittle have stolen millions of dollars of Bionyne equipment and are breaking bioethics. He spends the seventeen days removing evidence of Zoe's existence from his home, and creating cover stories of illness to explain his family's absence from work, school, and social media contact.\nWhen Foster notices his wife's central nervous system reacting to his touch, he realizes that Subject 345 failed because the mind expects connection to a biological body with heartbeat and respiration, rather than a synthetic one. He knows now that transfer into the clones will not be a problem, and the failure of android transfer can be solved by programming a simulated mind-body interface to make the android body appear biological. He successfully transfers the minds of his loved ones into the cloned bodies, then goes back to work creating a synthetic mind-body interface. When the next dead body he receives has suffered too much brain damage to be viable, Foster resorts to recording his own mind for the android transfer. Meanwhile, Sophie has a nightmare of her mother's death, and Mona catches Foster erasing her memory of the event. He confesses that they died in a car crash and that he resurrected them. The family soon discovers evidence of Zoe's existence that he missed, and he admits that he couldn't save Zoe and erased their memories of her.\nJones confronts Foster and reveals that he is aware of what Foster and Whittle have done. He tells him the research is not actually intended for medical purposes, but is being financed by the U.S. government to provide a military weapon, and that Foster's family are loose ends to be eliminated. Foster destroys the mind-body interface, incapacitates Jones, and flees, attempting to escape by boat. Jones' henchmen capture Foster's family. He pursues them to Bionyne, where it is clear that Whittle has sold them out. Jones kills Whittle and forces Foster to finish Subject 345. Foster uploads his own mind into Subject 345, who kills the henchmen and mortally wounds Jones. The two Fosters make a deal with Jones: he can live in a cloned body and become rich by working with Foster-345, selling clone transfers to wealthy people looking for a second life.

She flirts with the doctor, Brian (Kurt Johnson), at the hospital, who is convinced that she is  experiencing \"survivor's syndrome\" in which sole survivors experience guilt and either commit suicide or put themselves in dangerous situations. Denise also receives some ambiguous warnings from psychic ex-actress Carla (Caren Larkey) who predicted the crash. A series of strange sightings and encounters of zombie-like people escalates until it is apparent that something is trying to kill her as people around her start dying as well. Her skeptical boyfriend (Brian the doctor) thinks Denise is going crazy until he finds out that a number of recently dead people\u2014including one that Denise claims attacked her\u2014were found with all of the blood in their bodies drained into their legs as if they had died standing upright.Plagued by night fears as well as a series of near-miss accidents that happen to her, Denise confides in her best friend and neighbor, Kristy (Robin Davidson), about what is happening, but Kristy, also, is skeptical. Denise becomes convinced that what is happening to her is supernatural in nature. Thinking that she was supposed to die in the air crash, Denise speculates that the specter of death is making people who have recently died come back to life and stalk her before finding an opportunity to kill her to finish what the chain of events that began with the plane crash started.\nOne rainy evening, when a man, a highway inspector who just died, breaks into Denise's house, he happens to find Kristy instead, whom he kills by drowning. Denise walks in and barely escapes and calls the police who take her in for questioning only to find the man that Denise identified as attacking her was found dead a short distance away and who had been dead for several hours. Also, Kristy's body is missing.

Brian arrives with a gun to attempt to stop them or help Denise, but he too ends up getting stabbed and killed by the undead Kristy. Denise manages to escape from her house and drives through the nearby city which is deserted, but the car breaks down and she finds herself alone on the streets... aware that somewhere in a hospital or a morgue or a back alley that there is a person who has just died and will become a reanimated corpse for the sole purpose of killing her.

{"id": "tt0024188", "text": "Shipwrecked traveler Edward Parker (Richard Arlen) is rescued by a freighter delivering animals to an isolated South Seas island owned by Dr. Moreau (Charles Laughton). After Parker fights with the freighter's drunken captain (Stanley Fields) for his mistreating M'ling (Tetsu Komai), an odd-looking passenger with some bestial features, the captain tosses Parker overboard into Mr. Montgomery's (Arthur Hohl) boat, bound for Moreau's island .\nWhen Parker arrives at the island, Moreau welcomes Parker to his home and introduces him to Lota (Kathleen Burke), an attractive, but somewhat odd, scantily-clad young woman who seems fearful and withdrawn. When the two hear screams coming from a locked room, which Lota calls \"the House of Pain,\" Parker investigates. He sees Moreau and assistant, Montgomery, operating on a man-like creature without anesthetic. Convinced that Moreau is engaged in sadistic vivisection, Parker tries to leave, only to encounter brutish-looking humanoids resembling apes, felines, swine, and other beasts emerging from the jungle. Moreau appears, cracks his whip, and orders the one known as the Sayer of the Law (Bela Lugosi), a hairy wolf-like man, to recite the rules against violence (The Law). Afterward, the strange \"men\" disperse.\nBack in the main house, the doctor tries to assuage Parker by explaining his scientific work -- that he started experimenting in London many years before, accelerating the evolution of plants. He then progressed to animals, trying to transform them into humans through \"plastic surgery, blood transfusions, gland extracts, and ray baths\". When a dog-hybrid escaped from his laboratory it so horrified people that he was forced to leave England.\nHe confides to Parker that Lota is the sole female on the island, but hides that she was derived from a panther. Later he privately expresses his excitement to Montgomery that Lota is showing real human emotions in her attraction to Parker. So he can keep observing this process, Moreau ensures that Parker cannot leave by destroying the only available boat, placing blame for this on his beast-men.\nAs Parker spends time with Lota, she falls in love with him. Eventually the two kiss, but Parker is then stricken with guilt, since he still loves his fianc\u00e9e, Ruth Thomas (Leila Hyams). As Lota hugs him, Parker feels pain then examines her fingernails, which are reverting to animal-like claws. In a fit of rage, he storms into the office of Dr. Moreau to confront him over his criminal behavior in creating Lota. Dr. Moreau calmly explains that Lota is his most perfect creation, and he wanted to see if she was capable of falling in love with a man and bearing human-like children. Parker violently knocks Moreau to the ground, and demands to leave the island. When Moreau realizes Lota is beginning to revert to her panther origin, he first despairs, believing that he has failed \u2013 until he notices Lota weeping, showing human emotion. His hopes are raised and he screams that he will \"burn out\" the remaining animal in her in the House of Pain.\nMeanwhile, the American consul (George Irving) at Apia in Samoa, Parker's original destination, learns about Parker's location from the cowed freighter captain. Fianc\u00e9e Ruth Thomas persuades Captain Donahue (Paul Hurst) to take her to Moreau's island. She is reunited with Parker, but Moreau persuades them that it is too dangerous in the dark to return to Donahue's ship through the beast-inhabited jungle. They reluctantly agree to stay the night. The apelike Ouran, one of Moreau's creations, tries to break into Ruth's room. (It is implied that this may have been arranged by Moreau, curious if his beast-men can successfully mate with humans.) Fortunately, she wakes up and screams for help, and Ouran is driven off. Donahue then offers to try to reach the ship and fetch his crew. Moreau, seeing him depart, dispatches Ouran to strangle him.\nThis has an unforeseen effect, however. The beast-men no longer feel bound by Moreau's Laws, as he has himself broken one of them. Reverting to their animalistic nature, they set their huts ablaze and defy Moreau, who tries to regain control, but to no avail. In desperation, he demands of them, \"What is the Law?\" Their response is, \"Law no more!\"  The beast-men drag the doctor into his House of Pain, where they bind him, screaming, to the operating table and dismember him with his own surgical knives.\nWith help from the disaffected Montgomery, Parker and Ruth make their escape. Parker insists they take Lota along. When Lota sees Ouran following, she waits in ambush. In the ensuing struggle, both are killed. The others escape by boat as the island goes up in flames, presumably destroying Moreau's work and eradicating the beast-men.", "title": "Island of Lost Souls (1932 film)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q1862094"}}

He inserts a coin into an unusual antique arcade fortune teller machine called Zoltar, and makes a wish to be \"big\". It dispenses a card stating \"Your wish is granted\", but Josh is spooked when he notices that it has been unplugged the entire time.\nThe next morning, Josh has suddenly grown into a full-fledged adult; it turns out the Zoltar machine can actually make wishes come true. He tries to find the machine, only to see an empty field, the carnival having moved on. Returning home, he tries to explain his predicament to his mother, who refuses to listen and then threatens him, thinking he is a stranger who has kidnapped her son. Fleeing from her, he then finds his best friend, Billy, and convinces him of his identity by singing a rap which only they know. With Billy's help, he learns that it will take at least six weeks to find the Zoltar machine again, so Josh rents a flophouse room in New York City and gets a job as a data entry clerk at the MacMillan Toy Company.\n\nJosh meets the company's owner, Mr. MacMillan, at FAO Schwarz, and impresses him with his insight into current toys and his childlike enthusiasm. They play a duet on a Walking Piano (a foot-operated electronic keyboard) performing \"Heart and Soul\" and \"Chopsticks\". MacMillan invites Josh to a massive marketing campaign pitch meeting with the senior executives. Unimpressed with the toy, Josh shocks and challenges the executives with a simple declaration that the toy is not \"fun\", and while his follow-up suggestions invigorate the team for new ideas, he earns the animosity of Paul Davenport, the pitch's leader. Pleased, Mr. MacMillan promotes Josh to his dream job: getting paid to test toys as vice president in charge of Product Development. With the promotion, his larger salary enables him to move into a spacious luxury apartment, which he and Billy fill with toys, a rigged Pepsi vending machine that dispenses free drinks, and a pinball machine. He soon attracts the attention of Susan Lawrence, a fellow MacMillan executive. A romance begins to develop, much to the dismay of her ruthless former boyfriend and coworker, Davenport. Josh becomes increasingly entwined in his \"adult\" life by spending time with her, mingling with her friends, and being in a steady relationship. His ideas become valuable assets to MacMillan Toys; however, he begins to forget what it is like to be a child, and his tight schedule now means that he never has time to hang out with Billy.\nMacMillan asks Josh to come up with proposals for a new line of toys. He is intimidated by the need to formulate the business aspects of the proposal, but Susan says that she will handle the business end while he comes up with the ideas. Nevertheless, he feels pressured and longs for his old life. When he expresses doubts to Susan and attempts to explain that he is really a child, she interprets this as fear of commitment on his part and dismisses his explanation.\nJosh learns from Billy that the Zoltar machine is now at Sea Point Park. He leaves in the middle of presenting the proposal to MacMillan and the other executives. Susan also leaves and encounters Billy, who tells her where Josh went. At the park, Josh finds the machine, unplugs it, and makes a wish to become \"a kid again\". He is then confronted by Susan, who, seeing the machine and the fortune it has given him, realizes that he was telling the truth. She becomes despondent at realizing their relationship is ending. He tells her that she is the one thing about his adult life that he wishes would not end and suggests that she use the machine to wish herself younger. She declines, saying that being a child once was enough, and takes him home.\nAfter sharing an emotional goodbye with Susan, Josh becomes a child again before reuniting with his family.

Rumors of the Owens women being witches have existed for generations in the small close-minded town in which they live, despite there being no hard evidence. The Owens women are also under a curse that any man with who they fall in love is doomed.

More introspective Sally, who has sworn off the use of magic except in its most practical sense, has taken measures not to fall in love because of the curse, but ends up falling for and marrying Michael (Mark Feuerstein), a local merchant, the two who end up having two daughters of their own. The curse works its way into Gillian's and Sally's lives in different ways.

His brother, a prominent government physicist, refuses to take him seriously and has essentially shut Dr. Stone out of his life. Dr. Stone's attractive secretary, Ms. Elizabeth Dunn, is in love with him and has read all of his recondite scientific papers, but Stone is blind to her feelings and myopically perceives only the details of his science.\nThe story begins as policemen investigate the destruction of Dr. Stone's office, the latest in a series of attacks on optometric facilities. After they leave, Dr. Stone realizes that his own glasses are broken and decides to try a pair of prescription lenses designed for patients who suffer from double vision, lenses made from meteoric quartz. Putting on the glasses, he recoils in horror as he sees a creature that appears to be made of energy. The creature attacks him, smashing his glasses, steals a page from Stone's notebook on which are written the names of patients who have been prescribed the lenses, and quickly vanishes.\nStone ascertains that the creature must exist in only two dimensions, as when he turns sideways he becomes invisible, and is able to move through walls. Stone visits his physicist brother to talk over the idea, but his brother dismisses him as mad. Dr. Stone has his secretary order several new pairs of the meteoric eyepieces, and tries to track down the patients sought by the two-dimensional creature. One has been injured, another is found dead, and the third, a welder, managed to ward off the creature with his welding torch (later Stone is told by the creature that in the second dimension, fire is all-powerful because two-dimensional organisms, like dry leaves or paper, are easily set aflame). It is also discovered that a large building has been cut in half. Stone's brother and the police begin to investigate these occurrences. Meanwhile, in the excitement of the moment, Stone suddenly seems to notice the love-struck Ms. Dunn for the first time, remarking after putting on a different pair of glasses that something about her \"looks different,\" as she glows with adoration towards him.\nSoon, the creature appears again to Stone after he puts on a pair of the meteoric glasses. The creature, the titular Eck, explains that he was trapped in our dimensional plane when he fell through an experimental portal. He needs to return to the second dimension through the rift and close it, or else the rift could cause all kinds of things from his dimension to spill through. Eck is unable to see properly in three-dimensional space, and requires lenses to correct his two-dimensional vision so that he can find the rift. Eck gives Stone one of his eyes, a translucent triangle shaped object, though he asserts that a lens must be constructed in 24 hours as he is dying. Stone begins to grind the interdimensional lens.  Meanwhile, Eck watches a TV broadcast about himself.  Thinking the broadcaster is also two-dimensional, he jumps into the TV set to seek help.  This causes him to become luminous, and thereafter can be seen without the special glasses.\nThe now-visible Eck wreaks more havoc in the city, then returns to Dr. Stone's office.  The police and Stone's brother have determined that Stone is harboring the creature, and break into his office with a flamethrower. They attack Eck with fire, and apparently kill him. After they leave, Dr. Stone and Elizabeth find Eck alive, having deceived his attackers. They produce the interdimensional lens, which Eck tries to take with him through a wall but cannot as the lens is three-dimensional. Stone and Elizabeth offer to bring the lens with them to the public square, where the rift is located. Eck exits through the wall, Stone asks Elizabeth if she would like to go to the square to \"say goodbye to a friend,\" and the two exit as a couple, Stone's arm still around Elizabeth's waist.", "title": "Behold, Eck!", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q4425259"}}

He regularly partakes in drug use with his friends: Simon \"Sick Boy\" Williamson, a treacherous, womanising James Bond fanatic; Daniel \"Spud\" Murphy, an outwardly docile confidence trickster; and Swanney, \"Mother Superior\", their dealer. Renton is warned about the dangers of his drug habit by his other friends, Francis \"Franco\" Begbie, an aggressive psychopath, and Tommy Mackenzie, a footballer, who both abstain from drugs. Growing tired of his reckless lifestyle, Renton attempts to wean himself off heroin with opium suppositories given by dealer Mikey Forrester. At a nightclub, Renton notices that his cessation of heroin use has increased his libido. He woos a girl named Diane Coulston and they have sex in the apartment owned by her parents, but is horrified to learn that she is below the age of consent. Diane uses this as a threat against Renton to continue their relationship.\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts to reintegrate into society, Renton, Sick Boy and Spud relapse into heroin use. Tommy also begins to dabble in drug use, after becoming depressed due to being dumped by his girlfriend Lizzy, thanks to the unknowing actions of Renton. Even the negligence-induced death of Dawn, the infant daughter of Sick Boy and his girlfriend Allison, does not persuade the group to recover.

However, to Renton's exasperation, Begbie, who is wanted for a failed armed robbery, tracks him down and takes up refuge with him. They are soon joined by Sick Boy, now trying to be a pimp and drug dealer. Begbie and Sick Boy later attack two of Renton's clientele, resulting in him losing his job, and the trio return to Edinburgh, both to avoid police attention and for the funeral of Tommy, who has died of AIDS-related toxoplasmosis.\nFollowing the funeral, Sick Boy asks Renton, Begbie and Spud (who has been recently released from prison) for help in buying two kilograms of pure heroin for \u00a34,000 to later resell at a higher price; Renton is needed to supply the remaining \u00a32,000 asking price. After Begbie threatens him, Renton reluctantly covers the remaining cost, and the group returns to London to sell the heroin to a major dealer for \u00a316,000. As they celebrate in a pub, Renton secretly suggests to Spud that they could both leave with the money, but Spud, motivated by fear of Begbie and loyalty, refuses. However, Sick Boy indicates he would happily do so, and Begbie brutally beats a man after a petty confrontation.

{"id": "tt0117913", "text": "In the fictional town of Clanton, Mississippi, ten-year-old African American Tonya Hailey is abducted, raped, and beaten by two local white men, Billy Ray Cobb and James Willard. The duo dump her in a nearby river after a failed attempt to hang her. Tonya survives, and the two men are arrested by Sheriff Ozzie Walls.\nTonya's father, Carl Lee Hailey, contacts Jake Brigance, a white lawyer who previously defended his brother. Brigance admits the possibility that the rapists will walk free. Carl Lee goes to the county courthouse and opens fire with an automatic rifle, killing both rapists and unintentionally injuring Deputy Dwayne Looney, whose leg is later amputated. Carl Lee is arrested and Brigance agrees to defend him.\nThe rape and subsequent revenge killing gain national media attention. The district attorney, Rufus Buckley, decides to seek the death penalty, and presiding Judge Omar Noose denies Brigance a change of venue to a more ethnically-diverse county, meaning that Carl Lee will have an all-white jury. Brigance seeks help from his defense team: law student Ellen Roark, close friend Harry Rex Vonner, and former mentor and longtime activist Lucien Wilbanks, a once-great civil rights lawyer. Meanwhile, Billy Ray's brother, Freddie Lee Cobb, plans to avenge his brother's death by joining and enlisting the help of the Mississippi branch of the Ku Klux Klan and its Grand Dragon, Stump Sisson.\nOn the first day of the trial, the Klan rallies, only to be outnumbered by counter-protesters consisting of the area's black and multiracial residents, as well as whites who support Carl Lee. The protest erupts into a violent brawl that results in dozens of injuries and the death of Stump Sisson. The Klan also begins to target Brigance, assaulting his elderly secretary and her husband, who dies of a heart attack brought on by the assault. They also burn a cross on his lawn and threaten his wife and daughter. When Brigance refuses to back down, Cobb kidnaps and assaults Roark. The Klan then increases their attacks, including burning Brigance's house.\nDispirited, Brigance tells Carl Lee that there is little hope for an acquittal. Carl Lee replies that he had chosen Brigance as an attorney because he is a white man and has insight into how the jury sees Carl Lee. \"When you look at me, you don't see a man, you see a black man. (...) You are my secret weapon because you are one of the bad guys. You don't mean to be, but you are. It's how you was raised. (...) No matter how you see me, you see me different, you see me like that jury sees me, you are them. (...) If you was on that jury, what would it take to convince you to set me free?\". During closing arguments, a deeply-shaken Brigance tells the jury to close their eyes and listen to a story. He describes, in slow and painful detail, the entire ordeal of Tonya. Brigance then asks the jury, in his final comment, to \"now imagine she's white.\"\nAfter deliberation, a black child runs out of the courthouse and screams, \"He's innocent!\" Jubilation ensues amongst the supporters outside. The Klan members, enraged, begin yelling in anger. Meanwhile, Sheriff Walls arrests Freddie Lee for his crimes, as well as a corrupt deputy who is also a member of the Klan and is standing next to the sheriff.\nBrigance brings his wife and daughter to a family cookout at Carl Lee's house to celebrate his freedom.", "title": "A Time to Kill (1996 film)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q498867"}}

opportunistic boss Franklin Hart, Jr.\n(Dabney Coleman), and Roz Keith (Elizabeth Wilson), Hart's executive assistant.\nViolet reveals to Judy that Hart is supposedly involved with his buxom secretary, Doralee Rhodes (Dolly Parton).\nHart exploits and mistreats his female subordinates, with backstabbing and sexist remarks.\nHe takes credit for Violet's ideas, cruelly yells at and threatens Judy on her first day after an equipment malfunction and sexually harasses Doralee, spreading rumors about an affair that never happened.\nWhen Violet discovers that a promotion she was hoping to receive was instead given to a man because of sexist hiring practices, she confronts Hart about it, as well as the rumors about Doralee (who enters Hart's office just in time to hear, and now realizes why she has become unpopular with the other secretaries).\nViolet storms off, stating that she needs a drink.\nDoralee takes Hart to task over his transgressions, informing him that she

women drown their sorrows at the local bar before retiring to Doralee's house to smoke a joint given to Violet by her teenage son.\nWhile there, the beginning of their friendship forms, and they share fantasies of getting revenge on mr Hart: Judy wants to hunt him down like an animal in a classic mobster scenario, Doralee wants to rope him like a steer in a Western scenario, and Violet wants to poison him in a twisted Snow White-style scenario.\nThe following day, a mix-up leads Violet to accidentally spike Hart's coffee with rat poison.\nHowever, before he can drink the tainted coffee, Hart

atmosphere-producing algae as the first stage of terraforming the planet.\nWhen the oxygen quantity produced by the algae is inexplicably reduced, the crew of Mars-1 investigate\u2014a crew consisting of Quinn Burchenal (Tom Sizemore), an agnostic geneticist; Bud Chantillas (Terence Stamp), an aging philosophical scientist and surgeon; systems engineer Robby Gallagher (Val Kilmer); commander Kate Bowman (Carrie-Anne Moss); pilot Ted Santen (Benjamin Bratt); and terraforming scientist Chip Pettengill (Simon Baker).\nWhen Mars 1 is damaged in arrival, Bowman remains aboard for repair while the others land to locate an automated habitat (HAB 1) established earlier to manufacture food and oxygen.\nDuring insertion, the team's landing craft is damaged and lands off-course.\nIn the aftermath, \"AMEE\" (Autonomous Mapping Exploration and Evasion)\u2014a military robot programmed to guide them\u2014is lost, and Chantillas suffers a ruptured spleen and internal bleeding, and tells the others to leave him behind.\nSanten refuses, but Chantillas tells them that they have limited oxygen left to make it to HAB 1.\nChantillas tells Gallagher that it is all right, as he got to see Mars for the first time.\nThe crew leaves to allow Chantillas to die in peace.\nIn orbit around Mars, Bowman contacts Houston, which informs her that Mars-1 is in decaying orbit, but offers hope of restoring engine function in departing Mars.\nOn Mars, the landing party find HAB 1 mysteriously destroyed.\nThey are baffled for an explanation, since the module was designed and field-tested in Tornado Alley to withstand any damaging storms on Mars.\nAll expect their imminent deaths by suffocation.\nPettengill and Santen wander from the others to explore, later to reach a canyon where Pettengill accidentally kills Santen, after they get into a fight over whether or not the mission was a failure, and that Pettengill realizes that Santen would never accept defeat.\nPettengill returns to Burchenal and Gallagher, and tells them that Santen killed himself.\nHis oxygen depleted, Gallagher opens his helmet, choosing a quick death over asphyxiation \u2013 and discovers that Mars' atmosphere is thin but breathable.\nThe only salvageable material from the habitat is all of the liquid fuel, which has ruptured out of its containers but pooled under the wreck.\nWith no remaining power in their suits, the astronauts set it on fire with a flare so they can have a bonfire to survive the massive temperature drop of the Martian night.\nAMEE reunites with the crew, and the three astronauts notice the robot is damaged and attempt to shut it down so they can recover its guidance device.\nPerceiving their actions as a threat, AMEE breaks Burchenal's ribs and pursues the others before retreating.\nGallagher tells the others she has gone into military mode, and intends to kill them all one by one.\nShe wounded Burchenal instead of killing him because she has been programmed with knowledge of the old guerrilla tactic that a wounded man will slow the enemy down since effort must be expended to transport a wounded teammate.\nEventually, Gallagher builds a makeshift radio from parts of the Mars Rover Pathfinder, through which Bowman instructs them to use a Russian probe's sample-return system to launch themselves into orbit.\nDuring the trip, Bowman tells Gallagher that the probe can hold only two people.\nThe trio takes shelter from an ice storm inside of a cave.\nDevastated by the recent news and afraid of being left behind, Pettengill flees with the radio, only to be killed by AMEE.\nAfter the storm subsides Gallagher and Burchenal recover the radio from Pettingill's corpse, and discover that it has become infested by insect-like native Martian life (identified by Burchenal as \"nematodes\").\nThe insects are highly flammable, as using a simple cutting torch on Pettengill's corpse to free his grip caused a chain reaction, making all of the insects in his corpse explode like firecrackers.\nLater, the two encounter a field of algae being eaten by the insects, and Burchenal pieces together what happened.\nThe Martian insects had lain dormant on their almost dead world, but when the probes from Earth spread algae fields across Mars it gave them a massive new food source and led to a population explosion.\nThe Martian insects are what caused the algae to disappear, but in the process they actually gave Mars breathable oxygen levels, because they produce oxygen as a waste product (explaining why they are so flammable).\nThe insects are also what destroyed the habitat module, as they tore in to get to the food supplies inside.\nBurchenal explains to Gallagher that the biochemistry of alien insects' respiratory metabolism is capable of producing oxygen far more efficiently than human science is currently able to.\nStudying the insects' biochemistry is the key to terraforming Mars, and may even lead to discoveries which will allow Earth's polluted atmosphere to be repaired.\nHowever, Burchenal is attacked by swarms of the insects when blood drips from an open wound.\nRather than be eaten alive, he passes his sample vial of insects to Gallagher before immolating himself and his attackers.\nGallagher reaches the Russian probe, finds sufficient fuel to power the rocket's engine, but not enough electrical power to launch the probe, and realizes that the only available replacement is AMEE's power core.\nIn a final confrontation, Gallagher is able to lure AMEE into a trap and disable her using one of the probe's sample launchers, then takes her battery.\nGallagher launches himself in the probe's sample-return capsule and reaches orbit where Mars-1 is waiting for him, and he is recovered and revived by Bowman.\nGallagher becomes upset that four astronauts died so that he could live, but Bowman tells him that they didn't die for nothing.\nThe computer is busy analyzing the sample of Martian insects which Gallagher brought back, and research on them might lead to repairing Earth itself.\nWith a six-month-long trip back to Earth, the computer has plenty of time to analyze the insects, and Bowman

Simon choose a hypnotist from a directory, and he chooses a woman named Elizabeth Lamb (Dawson).\nAs a first hypnotic exercise, Simon recalls where he put some car keys.\nElizabeth exposes the gang's plan to have her hypnotize him, and demands partnership.\nIn a next hypnotic episode, under gang supervision, Simon remembers that, shortly after the blow to his head, he awoke alone.\nOn finding the stolen painting hidden in his suit, he left the art gallery.\nDistracted by a phone text message, while crossing the road, he was hit by a red car.\nThe female driver tried to take him to hospital.\nSimon, in a kind of memory fugue, believed the woman was Elizabeth, recalling that she had made him forget her.\nThe gang tries violently to force Simon to remember where he put the painting, and that ends the hypnotic episode.\nWhen asked by Elizabeth about how he met Franck, Simon confesses that he has a gambling problem.\nFranck helped him pay his debts in exchange for his help in stealing the painting.\nFor the next step to recover the painting, Elizabeth tells Franck that she will sexually seduce Simon.\nSimon's feelings for Elizabeth recur, gently this time.\nAt the same time, Franck and Elizabeth have unanticipated sex, and she steals his pistol from his bedside drawer.\nNate, a gang member, sees them together and warns Simon, who confronts Elizabeth with it.\nShe responds by touching his erotic mindspot, related to Goya's Nude Maja.\nRemembering where the painting is, Simon goes with Franck and his associates to reveal the location, but overhears their plan to kill him.\nHe calls Elizabeth and tells her that the painting is in a red car in a certain car park, and unable to leave Franck's apartment, he returns and kills the gang members instead.\nAfter shooting Franck, Simon wakes up: this was all dream, and he still is in Elizabeth's apartment.\nElizabeth takes the car keys and goes to get the painting, leaving Franck's pistol for Simon.\nWhile searching for Elizabeth, Simon finds Franck in her apartment.\nNate and his associates intercept Elizabeth and bring her there.\nFranck takes Simon to get the painting, and as he kisses Elizabeth, she secretly passes three bullets into his mouth.\nOn the elevator, Simon stops Franck with a fire extinguisher, and then with the pistol, now loaded with the three bullets.\nIn the apartment, Nate prepares to rape Elizabeth.\nHeading back into the apartment, Simon shoots the three gang members.\nHe takes the car keys from Elizabeth, and loads the pistol with the remaining three bullets.\nHe takes Elizabeth to get the painting, and she tells him to let Franck come with them.\nWith Franck driving, Simon leads them to a parking garage where the painting is.\nThey collect the red car and drive it to a safe warehouse.\nDuring the trip, Elizabeth reveals that Simon was previously a client of hers.\nHe had a gambling addiction he wanted to fix.\nThey started an affair, and she found his erotic mindspot.\nHowever, he became obsessed with her, and eventually abusive.\nFearing for her life, she re-directed the hypnosis to make him forget her.\nThis led him back into his gambling addiction, which as previously stated, caused him to go in debt and to try to pay it off by stealing a painting, with the help of Franck.\nSimon recalls that, after the heist, when he was hit by the red car and mistook the female driver for Elizabeth, he strangled her.\nAt the warehouse, in the car's trunk, Elizabeth finds the painting and the body of the female driver.\nSimon, having at last remembered his past and wanting to forget, douses the car in fuel with Franck zip-tied to the steering wheel, sets it on fire and tells Elizabeth to run away with the painting.\nShe runs away but promptly returns driving a truck which she drives into Simon, pinning him against the other car, and ultimately sending Simon, and the car Franck is trapped in, into the river.\nFranck manages to escape, while it is implied that Simon is killed.\nThe scene cuts to Franck swimming in his apartment while thinking of the event.\nHe gets out of the pool and receives a package.\nHe opens the package and finds an iPad that plays a video of Elizabeth talking about the painting, which is now hanging in her apartment.\nShe reveals that when she hypnotized Simon to make him forget her, she also hypnotized him to go back into his gambling addiction and then try to steal a painting to pay off his debt.\nWhen this happened, he would instead give the painting over to Elizabeth.\nThis explains why Simon took the painting away from Franck at the beginning and the text message he received before being hit by the car, which is revealed to be from Elizabeth telling Simon to deliver the painting to her.\nElizabeth tells Franck that he can search for her and try to find her, but also gives him the option to forget the entire ordeal, and a button for an app called \"Trance\" appears as the video ends.\nFranck is shown debating whether to press the button just as the screen cuts to black.", "title": "Trance (2013 film)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q502374"}}

Three Marines discover a cavern and start to scream as their helmet video feed goes black.\nIn The Bronx in 2013, veteran NYPD Special Operations Sergeant, Ralph Sarchie, stands over the corpse of an infant in a darkened alley. He and his partner, Butler, resume their nocturnal patrol for the 46th Precinct. A domestic disturbance call comes in over the radio. Sarchie probes the dispatcher for more information and finds out that the male at the address is a former Marine. He tells Butler that his \"radar\" is going off because maybe the former Marine still thinks he is fighting in the war.\nAt the site of the complaint, Sarchie and Butler encounter the shirtless and heavily tattooed former Marine, Jimmy Tratner, who insists his wife is okay. When his wife lifts her head, the officers see that she has been badly beaten. They notice deep scratch marks on the floor and are wary of a dog as they make the arrest. Jimmy resists them ferociously, eventually drawing a knife on Butler and fleeing the house on foot. Sarchie catches up to Jimmy and makes the arrest; although, not without suffering a sizable wound to his forearm that will require stitches. The officers notice that Jimmy's fingernails are cracked and bleeding, and they assume that he is mentally ill or high on drugs.\nSarchie and Butler are called to the Bronx Zoo after a woman has thrown her toddler into the moat surrounding the lion enclosure. They find the woman in the lemur pen. She is furiously scraping at the ground, and after they apprehend her, she rapidly recites the lyrics to \"Break On Through (To the Other Side)\". Sarchie notices a commercial painter inside the lion enclosure. He enters the pen to interrogate the mysterious man, but he is attacked by the lions and barely escapes.\nWhen the deranged woman, Jane Crenna, is transferred from the precinct to a mental health facility, a Jesuit priest, Mendoza, arrives at the family's request. He asks the officers several pointed questions about Jane's behavior at the zoo. When another domestic disturbance call comes in, Sarchie notices the complaint makes reference to doors and decides that he and Butler will respond. At the house, the family of three have been staying in the living room after a series of strange disturbances. There is one area of the house where light bulbs instantly burn out and candles will not remain lit.\nThe family explain that there were two painters working the basement, where most of the disturbances occurred. In the basement, Sarchie discovers the badly decomposing body of one of the painters, David Griggs. At Griggs' apartment, which is overrun by cockroaches and refuse, they find business cards for Alphonsus Painting company as well as a picture of Griggs with Jane Crenna and the child that she threw at the zoo. In another picture, Griggs is pictured in his Marine uniform with Jimmy Tratner and a third Marine, Mick Santino. They realize Santino must have been the painter at the zoo.\nMendoza visits Sarchie at the precinct and asks to view the surveillance tapes of Jane at the zoo. He believes that Jane is possessed by demons, and he explains that there is secondary evil created by humans and primary evil which comes from demons. Sarchie is skeptical, but when he reviews the surveillance footage with Butler, he hears strange noises and sees things that Butler does not. Sarchie returns to Jimmy Tratner's house and finds a wall that was being painted in Jimmy's home office. He scrapes away the paint to find a pictograph of an owl. At Sarchie's home, his daughter lies in bed as a stuffed owl stares ominously at her from a shelf in her bedroom. She is awakened by strange noises and frightened.\nBack at Tratner's home, Sarchie has scraped off the paint from the rest of the wall to find a bizarre mix of Latin and ancient pictographs. Sarchie finds some hard drives with footage from Tratner's deployments and watches the full footage from the palm grove in Diyala. In the cave, the soldiers found a carving of the same message that is on the wall in Tratner's home. Sarchie revisits the basement where he found Griggs' body, scrapes off the paint from a wall, and finds the message again. He reviews the zoo surveillance footage and sees the same message was being painted over by Santino in the lion enclosure. With Mendoza, he visits Jane Crenna in the mental hospital and shows her the message from the cave. She savagely bites Sarchie's already wounded forearm.\nMendoza decodes the message as a kind of bridge between Christian and pagan theology which would theoretically allow demons a door to the human world. He explains that certain people are more susceptible to such messages than others. He suggests that the voices and images Sarchie is seeing could be a result of his intuitive \"radar\", which means that he is also susceptible to the archaic message. Mendoza and Sarchie gradually share more of their personal histories with each other. Mendoza goes with Sarchie and Butler to an apartment building where they are attacked by Santino and Jimmy Tratner. Tratner is subdued by Mendoza's cross. Santino overwhelms and eventually kills Butler.\nAt Sarchie's home, his daughter is once again awoken during the night. Her stuffed owl rolls off the shelf and advances towards her bed. As she runs screaming from the room, she sees Santino in the hallway. Sarchie arrives home to find Santino in his living room. Santino warns that he has abducted Sarchie's wife and daughter.

They are then plagued by a series of apparitions or \u201cWinchester Tormentors\u201d, (victims of Winchester rifles) before two police officers, Cooper & Hunter, show up, having traced their call. Mrs. Winchester uses her ghostly wind and throws both the police off the porch, impaling them onto broken branches nearby, killing them.\nSusan contacts Dent who agrees to help them. Meanwhile, Drake has been coughing up blood and believes it's related to Mr. Winchester\u2019s death, attributed to tuberculosis but Dent disagrees. He explains the types of spirits and believes they have a poltergeist or \u201ctype two\u201d spirit as he puts it, a spirit that knows they are dead (type one being spirits that do not know they are dead). He suggests they try to communicate with it and find out what the spirit wants. When he does, they discover the spirit wants Annie, Mrs. Winchester's daughter who supposedly went missing, so Kent believes the spirit to be Sarah Winchester. Kent attempts to call the spirit of Annie and tells them that this will also call the Tormentor spirits so he draws a magic circle to protect them. Mrs. Winchester launches him into the fireplace before he can finish the circle, killing him.  Susan finishes the circle and protects herself and Drake from Mrs. Winchester, who vanishes.\nA spirit of a deaf employee of Mrs. Winchester, James Clayhill, appears and lures them to the attic. Under some boxes, they find a large chest and James urges them to open it. Inside is the mummified remains of Annie. Mrs. Winchester's ghost appears but changes from demonic to angelic; Her, Annie, and James\u2019 spirits disappear as some music is heard from inside a wall. Susan and Drake discover a crawlspace behind a thin wall leading to a sealed off room where Haley is sitting. Together, the family leaves the house and walks down the driveway. They find that their car is no longer at the gate so they walk down the road. Susan notices some tire marks at the side of the road leading into a ravine. She looks over the edge and discovers their car, crashed, with the three of them still inside, dead, revealing that when they narrowly missed the collision on the way to Winchester House, they actually drove over a ledge and died upon impact in the ravine below. Through brief flashbacks, this is shown to be the reason that the police could not hear them on the phone and why their keys to the mansion did not work. It's also revealed that Kent was trying to help the family of spirits \"pass on\", (them all being \"type one\" spirits, not knowing they had died) before he himself was killed. Instead of telling Drake and Haley this, she walks with them along the road back towards Winchester House as Drake coughs up blood.", "title": "Haunting of Winchester House", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q2054249"}}

After learning she is about to be deported back to Canada because she violated the terms of her work visa, she persuades her much abused assistant, Andrew Paxton, to marry her. She reminds Andrew that if she's deported, the work he put in as her assistant will be lost, and he'll be set back in his dream to become an editor. Mr. Gilbertson, a U.S. immigration agent, informs them that he suspects they are committing fraud to avoid Margaret's deportation. Gilbertson tells them that they'll be asked questions about each other separately. If their answers don't match, Margaret will be deported to Canada permanently and Andrew will be convicted of a felony punishable by a $250,000 fine and five years in prison. Andrew insists that Margaret make him an editor after their marriage and publish the book he's been recommending to her. Margaret is forced to agree.\nThe couple travels to Sitka, Alaska, Andrew's hometown, to meet his family. Margaret meets Andrew's mother Grace and grandmother Annie, known as \"Gammy\". During the trip to the family home, Margaret notices that nearly every shop in town carries the name Paxton and learns that Andrew's family is in fact very wealthy. During a welcome home party, Andrew confronts his father, Joe, who is angry about Andrew dating the boss he has so long disliked and thinks he is using her to get ahead in his career. After their argument, Andrew announces the engagement to everyone. Margaret also meets Gertrude, Andrew's ex-girlfriend. At the party they tell everyone the story of how Andrew proposed to Margaret. \nThe next day, Grace and Annie take Margaret to a local bar as part of her bachelorette party to watch a strip dance by a locally famous but over-the-hill exotic dancer, Ramone. Stepping away from the show, Margaret learns from Gertrude that Andrew wanted to become an editor and make his own life and that Andrew had proposed to Gertrude. However, Gertrude refused because she didn't want to leave Sitka for New York. Returning home, Margaret learns of the conflict between Andrew and Joe. That night, Margaret asks Andrew about his relationship with his father, but Andrew refuses to talk. Instead, Margaret opens up to Andrew.\nThe next day, the family convinces them to marry while they're in Sitka. After Margaret realizes how close Andrew's family is, she becomes upset, gets on Andrew's boat, and speeds away with him. She tells him she has been alone since she was sixteen years old after her parents died and had forgotten what it felt like to have a family. She lets go of the helm and stumbles to the back of the boat. Andrew makes a sharp turn to avoid hitting a buoy, and Margaret falls out of the boat. Andrew quickly turns the boat around and saves her because she can't swim. At the wedding ceremony, Margaret confesses the truth about the wedding to the guests, including Gilbertson, who informs her she has twenty-four hours to leave for Canada.\nMargaret returns to the Paxton home to pack her things. Andrew rushes to their room only to find Margaret has already left, leaving his book manuscript with a note of praise and a promise to publish it. Gertrude attempts to comfort Andrew and asks approvingly if he is going to go after her. As he rushes out to find Margaret, another argument arises between him and Joe. Annie appears to have a heart attack, causing her and the family to be airlifted to the hospital and convinces them to reconcile before she \"passes away\". After she succeeds in getting things moving again, she admits to faking the heart attack as it was the only means to get their attention and tells the pilot to head to the airport in hopes of catching up to Margaret. Andrew's parents realize he really loves Margaret. He goes to New York and tells Margaret he loves her in front of the entire office staff. They kiss, then go to Gilbertson and inform him they are again engaged, but for real this time.

He converses schizophrenically with himself via tape recordings of his own voice. He is also being hounded by Randy (Al Cliver), a shady loan shark whom he owes money to after accruing bad gambling debts.\nLester picks up a certain Maggie MacDonald (Sasha Darwin), an obnoxious, hysterical, mustached, sexually frustrated alcoholic, whom he invites over at his house for dinner. His attempt to poison her is thwarted because she is already so drunk when she arrives at his place that she spills her glass of wine onto the floor. On the next attempt, she giddily mixed up his glass of wine with hers. He finally loses patience on the third try when she swallows the poisoned glassful, only to vomit before it can take effect. As Maggie excuses herself to the bathroom to clean up, he attacks her with a wooden stick. Her scalp splits apart and she runs screaming from the bathroom with blood streaming down her face. He chases her down the corridor bashing her head repeatedly, causing skin to rip away from her face, and a single bloodshot eyeball to roll out of her right eye socket onto the floor. Playing dead for a few seconds, Maggie rises when Parson's back is turned and makes another mad dash for the front door, but is rounded up and punched unconscious. Furious and exhausted, the killer shoves her head into an oven and switches it on, leaving her slumped with her flesh slowly melting off her face. Dead at last, Parson shoves Maggie's body into the trunk of his Mercedes. But he has to chop off the corpse's feet to get the body to fit right.\nWhen Parson ditches the body at a construction site, he is observed by a local tramp (Marco Di Stefano), who proceeds to attempt to blackmail Parson. Not to be deterred, he follows the derelict as he leaves. Catching up with him on a long stretch of country road, Parson puts his foot on the gas peddle and pursues the terrified man, eventually crunching the vehicle under him. The cars wheels roll backwards over the mangled body. The next day, when Parson sees on the TV that the tramp survived long enough to give the police a description of his attacker. Parson decides to change his image by shaving off his beard and wearing contact lenses in place of his eyeglasses.\nParsons next victim is Alice Shogun (Ria De Simone), another crazed middle-aged woman who sings opera during sex. The weary killer strangles her to death with one of her stockings. Placing the body in the front seat of his car, Parson drives away, only to get pulled over by a motorcycle policeman and gets a speeding ticket. But the policeman does not notice that the woman with Parson is dead.\nTaking Alice's jewelry with him, he tries pawning it only to discover that is all fake. He tries to meet a horse fixer at a local racing stables for a tip about putting a bet on a horse, but the person never shows up. When more TV announcements give further descriptions of the mysterious killer, Parson is forced to chance his image again by dying the color of his black hair into brown, and wearing horn-rimmed, tinted eyeglasses.\nSitting morosely at home, Parson responds to an unlikely invitation to \"come on over\" from Virginia (Zora Ulla Kesler), a similarly bored, lonely, wealthy, but far younger woman than his previous victims, when she dials his phone number by accident. However, the otherwise desirable Virginia is revealed to have a large and unattractive blemish on her upper lip. Even though she seems eager for intimacy, he is repulsed by her ugly scar. After Parson rings up another bad gambling debt to Randy, he decides to kill Virginia to steal whatever money and jewelry she has on her and flee the country.\nThe following evening, Parson meets Virginia in her apartment suite for dinner.

position for forensic psychology, he is called back to active duty following the elaborately staged murder of a man in a high-rise apartment building.\nThe victim is suspended and surrounded by photography lights, the room sealed off except for a pinhole, creating a projected camera obscura effect on the apartment wall.\nThis crime scene bears many similarities to the Uncle Eddie murders, a series of similarly \"artistic\" killings, for which Stan was promoted following the prime suspect's death in an attempted arrest.\nStan relates some of his difficulties to Sandy, a recovering alcoholic and former prostitute who is a friend of Stan and Crystal, the final victim of Uncle Eddie, and Stan's apparent former lover.\nSandy invites Stan on a hiking trip with a group of friends, which Stan declines.\nA second killing quickly follows the first, in which the butchered corpse's limbs are hung independently from wires, creating the image of a raven when viewed from the proper angle.\nStan begins drinking heavily, even filling his coffee cup with vodka in the middle of work.\nHe also begins to have friction with Detective Carl (Scott Speedman), a recently promoted detective who is resentful of Stan's aloof attitude.\nFollowing this, Stan returns home to find his apartment has been broken into, the thief stealing an antique Victorian chair and replacing it with a taping of his inquiry following Crystal and Uncle Eddie's deaths.\nStan also notices a painting identical to the camera obscura projection in an antiques store, also painted with identical pigments to the Uncle Eddie killings.\nStan visits Detective Jorge \"George\" Ruiz, his former partner until the Uncle Eddie murders.\nAfter reminiscing briefly, Stan doesn't inform Ruiz of the copycat killings, and departs.\nPartway home he realizes he is being followed, and chases his stalker, who escapes.\nThe following morning, Stan is informed Ruiz has been found murdered, his abdomen opened and his innards removed, forming an inkwell of blood.\nThe scene includes a pantograph machine and a half-finished canvas.\nUsing his former partner's blood, Stan paints the other half of the painting, forming the image of a screaming face.\nThe other officers begin to suspect Stan.\nAttempting to replace his chair, Stan consults with Blair Collet, an antiques dealer who finds antique chairs for Stan, and likens Stan to the killer's patron, as he bought the painting from the antiques store, or his obsession, similar to Francis Bacon's obsession with Pope Innocent.\nBlair then takes Stan to an art gallery which is filled with model depictions of the recent murders, including Stan's stolen chair.\nThe curator informs them that the artist is Gerri Harden.\nSearching the art pieces, Stan finds a clay model of the raven, with hundreds of fingerprints still present on the clay.\nThis leads them to a warehouse with a dummy model wearing a Gerri Harden name badge, and several paintings, when Stan realizes the name is an anagram from 'a red herring'.\nDuring this time, he receives a photograph of Sandy and her friends from the hiking trip.\nThe next day, Stan receives a call from the killer, who repeatedly tells him \"a poison harms\" (An anagram for anamorphosis, the artistic technique he is using), and tells Stan to come see his next show, which is another empty warehouse containing diagrams of the final Uncle Eddie murders, including Crystal's, which, when viewed from high above, had the appearance of a body on a rock by a beach shore.\nStan, at home, receives a call from Sandy with another invitation, when he realizes that the man who had been stalking him is in the picture.\nHe fails to reach Sandy, and tries her AA group, when he learns her sponsor, the man in the picture, drove her away.\nSandy is receiving a tattoo of angel's wings, provided by the killer.\nShe blithely remarks that he might be too high to finish, and comments that she's never seen him high, and he responds that he'd never put that poison in his veins.\nSandy begins to struggle, first for a chance to look at the tattoo, and then for a break, and the killer slits her throat.\nStan appears at the studio, without having called in for backup.\nHe sees Sandy slumped over as the killer walks past her.\nStan follows the killer, wounding him in the shoulder before being stabbed.\nThe killer drags him to the podium and the chair that they'd found the dummy in and props Stan in place.\nStan, noticing the tattoo with an eye stenciled beneath it, places his head on Sandy's back, revealing that, when viewed in conjunction with the warehouse floor, spells out the word 'DEAD', a hallmark of the Uncle Eddie murders.\nDuring this, Detective Carl, at his desk, notices a reflection in the first murder photo off his coffee cup, of the raven in the second murder.\nSearching the raven, he finds the face from the third killing, and in the third killing painting, finds an image of the

The two boys set out to an island on the Mississippi River, where Neckbone has discovered an unusual sight-a boat, suspended high in the trees, a remnant of an extreme flood some time in the past. They climb the tree and into the boat only to find fresh bread and fresh footprints. Realizing that they are not the only ones who have discovered the treehouse boat, they decide to leave. When they reach the shore, they find the same footprint in their boat. And that's when they meet _Mud_ (qv) (Matthew McConaughey). _Mud_ (qv) is a gritty, superstitious character; his clothes are dirty, his tooth is cracked, and he needs help. He tells the boys he will give them the treehouse boat, his current hideout, in exchange for food. Neckbone is reluctant, but Ellis brings food to _Mud_ (qv), and they develop a tentative friendship. Ellis learns that _Mud_ (qv) has killed a man in Texas, and police and bounty hunters are looking for him, but _Mud_ (qv) is more concerned about reuniting with his longtime love, Juniper (Reese Witherspoon). Ellis, who has recently developed his own crush, agrees to help _Mud_ (qv) escape with Juniper. Ellis and Neckbone carry out bold schemes in an effort to protect _Mud_ (qv) and relay messages to Juniper, who is holed up in a fleabag motel, under constant surveillance by Carver (Paul Sparks), a Texas bounty hunter. Carver and his gang are intent on capturing _Mud_ (qv), on orders from the cold-blooded King (Joe Don Baker). As the boys risk everything to reunite these seeming mythical lovers, Ellis's own ideas about love and romance are challenged by the strains in the relationships closest to him: his parents' marriage is dissolving while he himself falters in his efforts to impress May Pearl (Bonnie Sturdivant). Through it all, Ellis struggles to look for an example of love that he can believe in, learning about the unspoken rules and risks of love and the reality of heartbreak.::Roadside Attractions\n\nIn Arkansas, 14-year-old Ellis lives in a floating house with his mother Mary Lee and his father Senior. Ellis helps his father selling fish with his best friend Neckbone. Ellis and Neckbone find a motorboat stranded on the top of a tree in an island on the Mississippi River since a flood and they plan to fix the boat for them. One day, they climb the tree and they find fresh meal inside the boat meaning that someone is living in \"their\" boat. They leave the place and meet a man named _Mud_ (qv) near their boat. Soon they learn that the passionate _Mud_ (qv) killed a man that had beaten up his girlfriend Juniper and now the father and the brother of the deceased man are hunting him down. _Mud_ (qv) makes a deal with the romantic Ellis and Neckbone to help him to reunite with Juniper. But when Ellis meets _Mud_ (qv)'s stepfather Tom, he has a different opinion about the love of Juniper with _Mud_ (qv).::Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nMississippi adolescents Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) are exploring along the mighty Mississippi when they stumble upon a small island inhabited by _Mud_ (qv) (Matthew McConaughey), a desperado who claims to be on the run from brutal bounty hunters after killing a man in Texas. According to _Mud_ (qv), his true love Juniper (Reese Witherspoon) is awaiting his arrival in town, and together they plan to make a daring escape. Fascinated, the two boys agree to help _Mud_ (qv) slip past his pursuers, despite the potential dangers of doing so..\n\nWith a pile of problems at home, and after hearing the fascinating rumour about a boat washed up into a tree on a small Mississippi island, the fourteen-year-old Arkansas boy, Ellis, and his best friend, Neckbone, summon up the courage to enter the mighty river. Indeed, such an unexpected treasure does exist; however, the mysterious tattooed gunman he calls himself _Mud_ (qv), he, too, lays claim to the vessel, unless the teenage adventurers agree to bring him food and help him find Juniper: his only true love. Now, as a formidable posse of Texan bounty hunters is after _Mud_ (qv), Ellis and Neckbone embark on a dangerous mission to reunite the doomed lovers, even if their reckless decision brings them face-to-face with grave consequences. Will they risk it all in the name of love?::Nick Riganas\n\nEllis and his friend Neckbone are two boys who meet _Mud_ (qv), a fugitive hiding out on an island in the Mississippi. Skeptical but intrigued by his fantastic scenarios, Ellis and Neckbone agree to help him.

{"id": "tt0463850", "text": "A minor earthquake in Seattle forms the trigger to a magnitude 10.5 earthquake which destroys San Francisco and then Los Angeles. The earthquake creates fault lines in the sea floor, which in turn creates a massive tsunami which capsizes a large cruise ship (which heavily resembles the Queen Mary 2) and causes massive damage to Honolulu, Hawaii. It turns out to be only the first of a series of seismic events, including the awakening of an extinct volcano in Sun Valley, Idaho and sudden instability of aquifers in Monument Valley. Deforestation takes place at Kings Peak, Utah, and Hoover Dam in Boulder City, Nevada collapses when Lake Mead starts to heat up and expand beyond the spillway's capacity. Las Vegas, Nevada is then destroyed when acidic water undermines underground limestone, creating a massive sinkhole which causes many buildings to simply sink into the sand. The worst of the seismic events is a massive fault which opens up under South Dakota, destroying Mount Rushmore in the process, and begins to travel southward towards the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe geologists at the United States Geological Survey in Colorado do not understand why seismic events that are very rare or impossible would be happening so rapidly, but Dr. Samantha Hill remembers that her father had once theorized that the Earth's tectonic plates would reach a point of maximum separation, at which point they would reverse direction. The theory also states that related seismic activity would be vastly accelerated during the initial period of reversal. However, Dr. Earl Hill had been ostracized by the USGS for that theory, and had abandoned geology to become a successful professional poker player. When Las Vegas sinks into the ground, he is caught in the casino of the (fictional) Atlas Hotel. Samantha concludes that the massive faultline traveling towards the Gulf of Mexico threatens to re-create the Western Interior Seaway when it reaches the ocean.\nThe second part of the miniseries begins with Dr. Hill's rescue from the ruins of the Atlas Hotel just before it is swallowed up completely. At the same time, a massive fault line forms in North Dakota, passing through South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Oklahoma. If it reaches Houston, Texas and the Gulf of Mexico, as predicted, the Midwestern United States will be covered by a new ocean. A massive evacuation of the region is ordered, as an earthquake strikes Sedona, Arizona destroying the Chapel of the Holy Cross in the process. However, a nuclear plant in fictional Red Plains, Texas, is right in the fault's path. If it is destroyed, the entire area and hundreds of miles around will be contaminated by nuclear waste.\nDr. Earl Hill comes up with a desperate plan to divert the fault around the nuclear plant by opening up a secondary fault running east, by a controlled demolition which explosively ignites the massive natural gas reserves in the area. The main fault follows the new path around Red Plains, saving the nuclear plant, and comes to a halt. The scientists at the USGS cheer, only to find that nothing can stop the fault altogether. Once again it turns south, slicing through the middle of Houston to reach the Gulf of Mexico, while the northern end of the fault reaches Hudson Bay. However, the end result of the fault is different from what the USGS had expected: when the waters rush into the fault, instead of flooding the entire area, they create a new riverlike seaway that splits the United States and Canada in half.

They decide to pull a group of six strangers together to race from Vegas to Silver City, New Mexico to retrieve $2 million hidden in a locker. First one there gets all of the money. The first team are two addled brothers (Duane and Blaine, who talks indecipherably because of a newly pierced tongue). When they cannot catch a plane, they plot to destroy an airport control tower in a very funny sequence.

She doesn't have any friends to hang out with, and appears awkward and uncomfortable when speaking to others.  Throughout the day, she is made fun of by several students, repeatedly called a \"squealer\". A series of flashbacks reveal that she called the police to a house party during the previous summer. Her reason for calling 9-1-1 was to tell the police that she had been raped by a senior student at the party, Andy Evans, but her trauma prevented her from reporting the rape over the telephone or to the police when they arrived.\nWhen her parents see her report card, they prompt Melinda to see a teacher named Mr. Neck, who tells her to write an essay on any history topic. After refusing to read her paper aloud to her class, she is sent to the principal's office. Melinda is nice to a new student named Heather Billings, who claims to be Melinda's \"friend\", but Heather soon abandons Melinda when the chance for social advancement arises. The only other student with whom Melinda has a positive experience is her lab partner, Dave Petrakis, who has successfully managed to avoid affiliating himself with a clique.\nThe restoration of Melinda's confidence progresses at a painfully slow rate, with some help from Dave and her art teacher, Mr. Freeman. Her former best friend, Rachel Bruin, starts dating Andy, and Melinda fears that Rachel will suffer the same fate as she did. Melinda meets Rachel at the library and tells her the truth about what happened at the party by writing it on paper. Rachel first refuses to believe, thinking that Melinda is lying out of jealousy and calls her \"sick\", but comes to realize the truth by confronting Andy who had spoken Melinda's name earlier (despite claiming to have never met any of Rachel's friends before). Rachel then avoids Andy out of anger for his lies and for fear of getting raped by him again, telling other people of what happened at the party all the while. Exposed as a rapist and a liar, Andy retaliates against Melinda, cornering her; he tries to force her to tell everybody at school that the incident is false and attempts to rape her again. Melinda struggles and throws a bottle of turpentine at his face, irritating his eyes, overpowers him after holding a shard of glass from a broken mirror to his neck, threatening to kill him. They are found by Melinda's distanced friend Nicole who, along with other girls from her field hockey team, help Melinda trap Andy to prevent further attack. The altercation removes any doubt about what happened at the house party, and the girls who restrain him are outraged by it and tempted to beat him with their sticks. Mr. Neck sees Melinda walking away from the scene and asks what was going on, but Melinda doesn't respond.\nOn the way back from the hospital after being treated for her injuries, Melinda rolls down the car window and breathes in deeply.

The raucous rugby players and a few of their relatives and friends are eagerly looking forward to an upcoming match in Chile.\nUpon emerging from clouds, the plane encounters turbulence and collides with a mountain. The wings and tail are separated from the fuselage, which slides down a mountain slope before coming to a stop. Six passengers and one flight attendant are ejected from the plane and die. Antonio, the team captain, coordinates efforts to help the injured. Roberto Canessa and Gustavo Zerbino, both medical students, aid the injured. Another six passengers soon die, including both pilots and Nando's mother, Eugenia. Nando, who sustained a head injury, falls into a coma, and his sister Susana has suffered harsh internal injuries.\nAs the sun sets, the survivors make preparations for the night. Canessa discovers that the seat covers can be unzipped and used as blankets. The survivors go inside the fuselage and curl up beside one another to stay warm. Antonio, Roy Harley, and Rafael Cano plug the gaping hole at the end of the fuselage with luggage to keep out the wind. Two passengers die overnight. With nothing to hunt or gather on the mountain, Antonio declares they will use rationing when the survivors find a tin of chocolates and a case of wine. After seeing a plane fly past, they think it dips its wing, and the survivors celebrate.

When Carlitos reminds him that he will need food, Nando suggests eating the flesh of the deceased pilots to give him the strength to survive the journey to find help. Susana dies from her injuries. The survivors listen to a radio for word of their rescue but are devastated to hear the search called off after nine days.\nAfter great debate, the starving passengers decide to eat the flesh of their dead relatives and friends. Zerbino, Rafael, and Juan Martino set off to search for the tail of the plane in hopes of finding batteries for the plane's radio to transmit their location. Among pieces of the wreckage, the teammates find additional corpses, but return to the group with news that the tail of the plane is likely a little farther away.

A speeding motor car frightens the horse, tipping the caravan over. Toad instantly discards the cart and becomes infatuated with motoring. He is a terrible driver and funds his cars with loans from the Weasels. Their vindictive Chief tries to persuade him to sell Toad Hall.\nAfter an uncontrollable drive into the Wild Wood and destroying a seventh motor car, Toad, Rat, and Mole are lost in the unwelcoming lair of the Weasels. The Weasels attempt to coerce Mole into stopping his friends from interfering with their plans. Toad is also attacked by the Weasels. The three end up in Mr. Badger's underground house. Badger, a close friend of Toad's late father who feels protective of Toad's inheritance, attempts to end Toad's love of motor cars. However, Toad refuses to listen to Badger and is ultimately arrested for stealing and crashing a motor-car outside a pub.

They have also damaged the area near to Badger's home, which provokes him into wanting revenge against them. Badger and Rat attempt to infiltrate Toad Hall disguised as weasels, but are discovered. Along with Toad, they are placed over the factory's mincing machine. The Chief, Clarence and Geoffrey return to Toad Hall to prepare the victory celebration, leaving St. John in charge of the machine. Mole, who has broken into the factory, disables the machine allowing Toad, Badger and Rat to escape.\nIn a premature sense of victory, Clarence and Geoffrey attempt to murder their Chief using a birthday cake. Clarence and Geoffrey begin to fight each other for leadership, with the other Weasels drunkenly taking sides. This distraction allows the protagonists to stage a raid on the house, leaving all of the Weasels incapacitated in the ensuing fight. It turns out that the Chief has survived the coup against his life. Toad attempts to stop him from reaching the factory, which contains the detonator to blow up Toad Hall, to no avail. Unbeknownst to both of them, the explosives are actually in the factory (Rat had switched the labels on the explosive's containers earlier, leading the Weasels to believe the explosives were actually bone supplies for the factory), and as such the Chief blows himself up along with the factory, leaving Toad Hall intact and Toad's friends alive.\nAfterwards, Toad makes a public speech swearing off motor cars and promising to be more mature and less selfish in the future.

A year later her sister Melissa, nicknamed 'Mouse' (Merle Kennedy), is now staying at St. Rita's Academy, a Catholic boarding school for troubled teenagers. She frequently has nightmares about her sister. Rumors spread around the school regarding Mouse, started by the school bully, Shirley (Zoe Trilling). However, the head nun at the school, Sister Gloria (Jennifer Rhodes), tries to put an end to it.\nHowever, Shirley, after getting banned from the school Halloween dance for wrestling on the tennis courts with Kurt (Ladd York) decides to have her own Halloween party at Hull House complete with Mouse and (as a prank) fake carrying out ritual sacrifice she learns from stealing a demonic ritual book from the school brain, Perry (Robert Jayne). Along with her boyfriend Rick (Rick Peters) and Z-Boy (Darin Heames), she tricks Johnny (Johnny Moran), Johnny's girlfriend, Bibi (Cristi Harris), Bibi's friend Terri (Christine Taylor) and Kurt (Ladd York)  to get Mouse to go with them to Hull House, awakening a now demonized Angela. After some bizarre incidents, the group flees the house, minus Z-Boy, who is possessed and raped by Angela in the attic.\nBibi brings a tube of lipstick out of the house which takes on a hellish life of its own. It quickly possesses Shirley and, one by one, Rick, Z-Boy, Terri and Kurt are possessed and/or murdered by demonic Angela (although Terri is saved when Sister Gloria exorcises the demon inside her with Holy Water).

The excavation leads to the discovery of a cave by a ground crew. Its existence is revealed to psychic Tangina Barrons, who informs her friend Taylor, a Native American shaman. After investigating the cave for himself, Taylor realizes that the spirit of Rev. Henry Kane, a deceased, insane preacher, whom he has seen in dreams is after Carol Anne and goes to defend her.\nThe Freeling family have relocated to Phoenix, Arizona, and now live in a house with Diane's mother, Jess. Grandma Jess is highly clairvoyant, and believes that Diane and Carol Anne possess the same abilities. Jess later dies from natural causes, but not before telling Diane one last time that she'll always \"be there\" if she needs her.\nTaylor shows up as Kane begins his first assault on the home. Unable to get in through the television as the family has removed all television sets from the home, Kane's minions are forced to find another way in, this time through Carol Anne's toy telephone. The attack fails, and the family gets out of the house quickly. Taylor introduces himself and convinces them that running would be a waste of time since Kane would only find them again, and they return to the house.\nKane himself shows up at the home one day in human form and demands to be let in, but Steve refuses. Taylor congratulates him for resisting Kane, and then takes Steve to the desert and gives him the \"Power of Smoke\", a Native spirit that can repel Kane. Tangina shows up at the house and helps Diane to understand Kane's history and how he became the Beast that is now stalking the family. She also points out that Diane is unique in that she is one of the only people on earth who have been to the spirit world while living. Diane has visions of Kane in the mid 19th century, when he was the head of an apocalyptic cult. Kane led his followers through the desert and into the cave, because he believed that the end of the world was coming, but then kept them trapped and captive there to slowly die with him after the day of his prediction came and went. Because he was so deranged and evil, Kane became a monster after death, and controls the souls of his followers. Taylor warns the family that Kane is extremely clever and will try to tear them apart.\nWith Taylor having left, the family's morale drops. Steve lets his guard down and gets drunk, swallowing a Mezcal worm that is possessed by Kane, who then temporarily possesses him. The possessed Steve tries to rape Diane, who cries out that she loves him, weakening Kane's hold. Steve then vomits up the worm possessed by Kane, which grows into a huge, tentacled monstrosity. In this form, Kane attacks Steve from the ceiling, but Steve uses the smoke spirit to send him away. The Beast launches another assault before the family flees. The Freelings decide to confront the Beast on his own turf, the Other Side.\nThe Freelings return to Cuesta Verde and, with Tangina, enter the cavern below their former home, where Kane pulls Diane and Carol Anne over into the Other Side. Steve and Robbie jump in after them through a fire started by Taylor. On the Other Side, which appears as a place of floating limbos without sense of direction, Steve, Diane, Robbie, and Carol Anne unite, but the now monstrously transformed Kane grabs Carol Anne and begins to drain her life force, but she is saved after Taylor gets a charmed Native spear into Steve\u2019s hands, and Steve stabs Kane with it, defeating the monster. Carol Anne nearly crosses over into the afterlife, but Jess' spirit appears and returns her to the family. The Freelings then return safely and thank Taylor and Tangina.\nSteve gives the family car to Taylor, after he had expressed an affection for it previously, and Taylor drives away with Tangina.

On his 18th birthday, he hacks into a local television station and changes the broadcast to an episode of The Outer Limits. Another hacker (handle \"Acid Burn\") counters Dade's attack. Dade identifies himself as \"Crash Override\".\nAt school, Dade becomes part of a group of hackers: Ramon \"The Phantom Phreak\" Sanchez, Emmanuel \"Cereal Killer\" Goldstein, Paul \"Lord Nikon\" Cook (named for his photographic memory), Joey Pardella (a novice hacker without an alias and the youngest member) and Kate \"Acid Burn\" Libby \u2013 the hacker who kicked him out of the TV network earlier.\nJoey, out to prove his skills, breaks into \"The Gibson\", an Ellingson Mineral Company supercomputer. While downloading a garbage file as proof of his feat, his mother disconnects his computer leaving him with a fragmented file. However, his intrusion has been noticed and brought to the attention of computer security officer Eugene \"The Plague\" Belford, a former hacker. Plague realizes the garbage file being downloaded is a worm he himself inserted to defraud Ellingson. Claiming the file is the code to the \"Da Vinci\" computer virus that will capsize the company's oil tanker fleet, and pretending the hackers are to blame, he enlists the US Secret Service to recover the file. In fact, The Plague had inserted the \"Da Vinci\" virus as a red herring to cover for his worm.\nJoey is arrested and his computer searched, but he had hidden the disk containing the file. Dade and Kate make a bet, with Dade choosing a date with Kate should he win, and Kate having Dade perform menial computing tasks if she prevails.

He has OCD,  seeks balance in life, and considers his case-solving ability to spot lies a curse. His friend Bouc, the nephew of the director of the luxury Orient Express train service, arranges a bunk for him to return to Delhi. Poirot boards the train with Bouc and thirteen other Passengers: American widow Caroline Hubbard, American businessman Edward Ratchett, with his English manservant Edward Masterman and secretary/translator Hector McQueen; elderly Russian Princess Natalia Dragomiroff and her German maid Hildegarde Schmidt; Hungarian diplomat Count Rudolf Andrenyi and his wife Elena; Medical Doctor John Arbuthnot; Mary Debenham, a teacher; Pilar Estravados, a Spanish missionary; Cuban-American car salesman Biniamino Marquez; and Gerhard Hardman, an Austrian university professor.\nRatchett offers to hire Poirot to be his bodyguard during the three-day journey, having received anonymous threatening letters. However, Poirot refuses upon learning that Rachett is a con artist. That night, Poirot hears noises coming from Ratchett's compartment, and sees someone in a red kimono running down the hallway. An avalanche derails the train's engine, stranding the passengers.\nThe next morning, Poirot discovers Ratchett has been murdered, stabbed a dozen times. Poirot and Bouc investigate the passengers as repairs begin. Evidence indicates that Ratchett was murdered by one person who dealt several blows, and Mrs. Hubbard claims that a man was in her compartment in the night. Poirot discovers a partially burned note connecting Ratchett to the kidnapping of Daisy Armstrong, a little girl who was abducted from her bedroom and held for ransom. Though the family paid the ransom, Daisy was murdered. Ratchett's true identity is revealed: he was John Cassetti, Daisy's kidnapper and killer. The shock of her death caused her mother Sonia to suffer a fatal miscarriage; her father, Colonel John Armstrong, who wrote to Poirot asking for his help, committed suicide shortly after. The family's nursemaid Susanne was wrongly suspected of complicity, leading to her arrest and subsequent suicide in police custody, only to be found innocent afterward.\nMore evidence is found, including a bloodstained handkerchief, and, in Mrs. Hubbard's compartment, the button of a conductor's uniform. The red kimono is later found in Poirot's own suitcase and the conductor's uniform is found in the cabin of one of the testifying passengers. Hubbard is suddenly stabbed in the back; she survives, but cannot identify the culprit. Poirot discovers many of the passengers have direct connections to the Armstrong family and uncovers their hidden pasts. While interviewing Debenham, Poirot is shot in the shoulder by Arbuthnot, who claims responsibility for the murder, but Bouc stops him from killing Poirot. Poirot realizes that Arbuthnot \u2014 a doctor and former army sniper \u2014 never meant to kill him.\nPoirot confronts the suspects outside the train, offering 2 theories of how Cassetti died. The first is simple but does not meet all of the facts: an agent of Ratchett's enemies disguised as a conductor boarded the train at a previous stop, murdered Cassetti, and fled at the stop as the train left. The second is more complex: with every single suspect connected to the Armstrongs, Susanne, or her trial in some way, and all had a motive against Cassetti: \n\nMacQueen's father was the district attorney for the kidnapping case, who was pressured into prosecuting Susanne and sending her to prison, only for his career to be destroyed when the truth was discovered after her suicide\nMasterman, who is terminally ill, was Colonel Armstrong's batman during the war, and later his valet, who also acted as butler to the Armstrong household\nDr. Arbuthnot was Colonel Armstrong's comrade and best friend\nCountess Andrenyi (n\u00e9e Goldenberg and real name Helena) was Sonia Armstrong's sister and Daisy's aunt\nCount Andrenyi was Sonia's brother-in-law\nPrincess Dragomiroff was Sonia's godmother, and a friend of her mother\nMs. Debenham was Sonia's secretary and Daisy's governess\nSchmidt was the Armstrong family's cook\nMarquez was the Armstrong family's chauffeur\nEstravado was Daisy's nurse\nHardman, whose real name is Cyrus and is American, was a former policeman in love with Susanne\nPierre Michel, the train's conductor, was Susanne's brother\nHubbard is revealed to be Linda Arden, a former stage actress and aspiring director, as well as Sonia's mother and Daisy's grandmother.Hubbard confirms Poirot's second theory, admitting that she planned the murder and had recruited everyone else to help her. All the other passengers and Michel took turns stabbing Cassetti. Debenham wore the kimono, and Arbuthnot stabbed Hubbard without endangering her life to convince Poirot of a lone killer. Poirot challenges the passengers and Michel to shoot him with a confiscated gun since he is the only one who can expose their plot; Bouc can lie, but Poirot, obsessed with truth and balance, cannot. Hubbard grabs the gun and tries to kill herself, but it is not loaded; Poirot wanted to see how the suspects would react and her reaction confirms none of them are truly killers at heart.\nWith the train back on track, Poirot concludes that justice is impossible in this case, as Cassetti deserved death and none of them deserve to go to jail. For the first time, Poirot will have to live with a lie and imbalance. He presents the lone killer theory to the Yugoslavian police and they accept it, allowing the others to leave on the train.

{"id": "tt0037017", "text": "Several British and American civilians, service members and merchant mariners are stuck in a lifeboat in the North Atlantic after their ship and a U-boat sink each other in combat. Willi, a German survivor, is pulled aboard and denies being the U-boat's captain. During an animated debate, engine room crewman Kovac demands the German be thrown out to drown. However, the others object, with radioman Stanley, wealthy industrialist Rittenhouse and columnist Connie Porter, who speaks German, succeeding in arguing that he be allowed to stay. Porter, initially alone in the boat, had managed to bring her luggage with her, and her primary concern at first is a run in her stocking. She is thrilled at having filmed the battle between the two vessels, but her movie camera is the first in a series of her possessions to be lost overboard in a succession of incidents.\nAmong the passengers is Mrs. Higley, a young British woman whose infant child is dead when they are pulled from the water after being saved by steward \"Joe\" Spencer. After being treated by a U.S. Army nurse, Alice, she must be tied down to stop her from hurting herself. The woman, still wrapped in Porter's mink coat for warmth, sneaks off the boat while the other passengers sleep, drowning herself in the night. Willi is revealed to be the U-boat captain.\nThe film then follows the lifeboat inhabitants as they attempt to organize their rations, set a course for Bermuda, and coexist as they try to survive. The passengers also cooperate through this stress, such as when they must amputate the leg of one of their boatmates, the German-American Gus Smith, because of gangrene.\nKovac takes charge, rationing the little food and water they have, but Willi, who has been consulting a concealed compass and reveals that he speaks English, wrests control away from him in a storm.\nOne morning, while the others are sleeping, Smith, who has been drinking seawater and is hallucinating, catches Willi drinking water from a hidden flask. Gus tries to tell Stanley but Stanley doesn't believe him because Gus also tells him he just had an ice-cold one with Rosie. Willi tries to coax Gus overboard, telling him that Rosie is waiting, but Gus keeps talking about the water, and, afraid someone will hear, Willi pushes him over the side. Gus\u2019 calls for help rouse Stanley and the others, but it is too late.\nAlice wishes she could cry for Gus, but tears are made of water. When they realize that Willi is sweating, Stanley remembers what Gus told him. Joe pulls the flask from Willi's shirt, but it breaks when Willi grabs at it. Willi explains that like everyone on a U-boat he had food tablets and energy pills. To survive, one must have a plan.\nIn a spasm of anger led by Alice, they descend upon him as a group, all but Joe, who tries to pull Alice back. Stanley grabs a piece of board and hits him repeatedly; the others use their fists to beat him and force him overboard. He clings to the side, out of camera, and while the others feebly pummel him, Rittenhouse grabs Gus' boot and delivers two sweeping and, by the sound, skull-crushing blows.\nLater on, as they drift, Rittenhouse says that he will never understand Willi's ingratitude. \"What do you do with people like that?\" No one answers. Stanley proposes to Alice, and she accepts, although they have little hope of surviving.\nConnie chastises everyone for giving up and pauses in her tirade on the exclamation \"ye gods and little fishes!\" Inspired, she offers her bracelet as bait. A fish strikes, but Joe sights a ship, and in the rush for the oars the line goes overboard and the bracelet is lost.\nIt is the German supply ship to which Willi had been steering them. But before a launch can pick them up, both it and the supply ship are sunk by gunfire from an Allied warship over the horizon.\nKovac estimates that the Allied vessel will be there in 20 minutes. Connie panics over the state of her hair, nails and face. Joe hopes his wife isn't worried. Rittenhouse admires a picture of Joe's family\u2014and still persists in calling him \"George\". Rittenhouse promises to honor his poker debt to Kovac: $50,000 ($735,000 today). Connie tells Kovac he is going to take it because he owes her a bracelet, a typewriter and a camera. He smiles and says \"Yes ma'am.\"\nA frightened, wounded, young German  seaman is pulled aboard the lifeboat. Rittenhouse is now all for killing him, and the others, including Kovac, have to hold him back. The German sailor pulls a gun but is disarmed by Joe. The seaman asks in German, \"Aren't you going to kill me?\" Kovac muses, \"'Aren't you going to kill me?' What are you going to do with people like that?\"  Stanley says \"I don't know, I was thinking of Mrs. Higley and her baby, and Gus.\"  \"Well,\" Connie says, \"maybe they can answer that.\"", "title": "Lifeboat (1944 film)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q1170179"}}

The kidnappers are able to elude the bodyguards, who are arrested.\nJeffers and Obecks are bailed out and returned to Chidduck by his right-hand man Joe Sarno. As Sarno begins coordinating Robin's rescue, Longbaugh contacts her gynecologist, Dr. Allen Painter, and orders him to a truck stop to examine Robin.

As Longbaugh hangs up the telephone outside the motel, he is approached by Sarno, who identifies himself as the \u201cbag-man\u201d and offers to pay $1 million if they surrender Robin and simply walk away. Longbaugh, who is clearly skeptical of the offer from a \u201cbag-man\u201d declines the cash offer, but accepts Sarno's subsequent offer to buy him a cup of coffee.

They steal his wagon and belongings, and Max continues on foot, following their trail to a survivor community named 'Bartertown'\u2014which has rebuilt ramshackle vestiges of basic civilization, even electricity. Initially refused entry because he has nothing to trade, Max is brought before the founder and ruler of Bartertown, the ruthless Aunty Entity. She offers to resupply his vehicle and equipment if he completes a task for her.\nAunty explains that Bartertown's electrical supply depends on a crude methane refinery powered by pig feces. The refinery is run by a dwarf called Master and his giant bodyguard Blaster. \"Master Blaster\" holds an uneasy truce with Aunty for control of Bartertown; however, Master has begun to challenge Aunty's leadership. Aunty instructs Max to provoke a confrontation with Blaster. According to Bartertown law, conflicts are resolved by a duel to the death in a gladiatorial arena called Thunderdome. Max enters the subterranean Underworld refinery area to size up Master Blaster and befriends Pig Killer, a convict sentenced to work for slaughtering a pig to feed his family. Max finds his stolen vehicle in Master/Blaster's possession and is forced to disarm his own booby-trapped engine. Here he discovers that although Blaster is exceptionally strong, he is hypersensitive to high-pitched noises, which severely disorient and incapacitate him.\nAccusing Master of the theft of his vehicle, Max provokes him into demanding justice for the insult by entering Blaster into a Thunderdome duel with Max.  Blaster dominates the duel until Max is able to use his bosun's whistle to gain the upper hand. Poised to kill Blaster, Max knocks his helmet off and is shocked to discover that Blaster has Down syndrome. Max refuses to kill a man with \"the mind of a child\" and confronts Aunty for deceiving him, thus exposing her plot. Master, previously unaware of this arrangement to kill Blaster, is furious and vows to shut down the refinery and, by extension, Bartertown. Aunty has Blaster killed, Master imprisoned, and Max exiled. He is bound on a horse and sent off in a random direction through the wasteland. When his mount perishes in a sinkhole, Max frees himself and presses on.\nNear death, Max is found by a desert dweller named Savannah Nix, who hauls him back to her home, \"Planet Erf\", a primitive community of children and teenagers who live in an oasis. The children, descended from survivors of a crashed Boeing 747, were left by their parents who went to find civilization. They believe Max to be the flight captain, G. L. Walker, with whom Max bears an uncanny resemblance, returned to fix the aeroplane and fly them to civilization. Max denies this and insists that they remain in the relative safety of the oasis, knowing that the only \"civilization\" within reach is Bartertown.\nSome of the children, led by Savannah, leave anyway, determined to find the prophesied \"Tomorrow-morrow Land.\" Max stops them by force, but another tribe member, Scrooloose, sets them free during the night and leaves with them. Their leader, Slake M'Thirst, asks Max to go after them, and he agrees, taking a few of the children with him to help. They find Savannah's group in danger but are unable to save one of the children from a sinkhole. With no supplies left, they are forced to head for Bartertown.\nThe group sneak in via an underground entrance, and, with Pig Killer's help, free Master and escape in a train-truck, destroying Bartertown's methane refinery in the process. Aunty leads the Imperial Guards in pursuit in their postmodern vehicles, catching up to the train. Max's group slows them down while Scrooloose hijacks one of the pursuing vehicles. The group comes across Jedediah and his son, and Max coerces Jedediah into helping his group escape with their aeroplane. Max uses his vehicle to clear a path through Aunty's men, allowing the aeroplane to take off and escape, leaving him at Aunty's mercy. Aunty spares his life, having come to respect him, and departs to presumably make good on her vow to rebuild Bartertown.\nJedediah flies the children to the coast, where they discover the nuclear-devastated ruins of Sydney. Years later, the children have established a small society of themselves and other lost wanderers in the ruins.

Truman, to be dispatched by Captain Bill Rhodes (Tom Skerritt) to extract Dr. Lena Fiore Kendricks (Monica Bellucci), a U.S. citizen by marriage and the widowed daughter-in-law of a U.S. senator. Their secondary mission is to extract the mission's priest (Pierrino Mascarino) and two nuns (Fionnula Flanagan and Cornelia Hayes O'Herlihy), should they choose to come.\nWaters gets to Kendricks, telling her that rebels are closing in on her hospital and the mission, and that his orders are to extract U.S. citizens; however, Kendricks refuses to leave without her patients. Waters calls Rhodes for options; after a brief conversation, he concedes to Kendricks' wishes and agrees to take those refugees able to walk. Kendricks begins assembling the able-bodied for the 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) hike; the priest and the nuns stay behind to take care of the injured.\nIrritated and behind the schedule, the team and the refugees leave the hospital mission after daybreak. At nightfall they take a short break. The rebels rapidly approach their position, and Waters stealthily kills one. Kendricks warns Waters that the rebels are going to the mission, but he is determined to carry out his orders, and they continue to the extraction point.\nBack at the mission, the staff and refugees are detained by the rebels. Despite the priest's pleas for mercy, the rebels murder him and the remaining occupants.\nWhen the team arrives at the extraction point, Waters' initial plan becomes clear: the SEALs suddenly turn away the refugees from the waiting helicopter. Waters forces Kendricks into the helicopter against her will, leaving the refugees stranded in the jungle, defenseless against the rebels. En route back to the Harry Truman, they fly over the original mission compound, seeing it destroyed and all its occupants murdered, as Kendricks had feared.\nRemorseful, Waters orders the pilot to return to the refugees. He then loads as many refugees as he can into the helicopter and decides to escort the remaining refugees to the Cameroonian border on foot.\nDuring the hike to Cameroon, the SEALs discover the rebels are somehow tracking them. As they escape and evade the rebels, the team enters a village whose inhabitants are being raped, tortured, and massacred by the rebels. Cognizant of his ability to stop it, Waters orders the team to kill the rebels. The team is visibly shaken by the atrocities they see the rebels have committed against the villagers.\nAgain en route, Slo determines that a refugee is transmitting a signal allowing the rebels to locate them. The search for the transmitter reveals the presence of Arthur Azuka (Sammi Rotibi), the surviving son of late President Samuel Azuka, which they realize is the reason the rebels are hunting them: Samuel Azuka was not only the president of the country, but also the tribal king of the Igbo. As the only surviving member of this royal bloodline, Arthur is the only person left with a legitimate claim to the leadership of Nigeria. Waters is angered that Kendricks knew this but did not inform him.\nA newer refugee (Jimmy Jean-Louis) picked up during the trek is discovered with the transmitter on his person. He attempts to run but is shot.\nThe SEALs decide to continue escorting the refugees to Cameroon, regardless of the cost. A firefight ensues when the rebels finally catch up with them, and the SEALs decide to stay behind as rearguard to buy the refugees enough time to reach the border safely.\nZee radios the Navy for air support; two F/A-18s take off and head towards them.

Enzo Ferrari however, uses Ford's offer to secure a more lucrative deal with Fiat that allows him to retain complete ownership of Scuderia Ferrari. In rejecting the proposed deal with Ford, Ferrari also intentionally insults both Ford Motor and Henry Ford II. In response, a furious Ford orders his racing division to build a car to defeat Ferrari at Le Mans. For this task, Iacocca hires Shelby American owner Carroll Shelby, a former driver who won Le Mans in 1959 but was forced to retire due to a heart condition. In turn, Shelby enlists the help of his friend Ken Miles, a hot-tempered British racer and struggling mechanic.\nShelby and Miles test the Ford GT40 Mk I prototype at Los Angeles International Airport, working out all of its design flaws until it is race-ready. Thinking that Miles is not their ideal driver, Ford opts to send Phil Hill and Bruce McLaren to the 1965 24 Hours of Le Mans instead. As predicted by Miles, none of the Fords finish the race. While Ford sees this as a humiliating defeat, Shelby explains to him that the GT40 instilled fear in Enzo Ferrari, as it reached 218 mph (350.8 km/h), on the Mulsanne Straight before it broke down. Shelby and Miles continue development on the GT40 Mk II, but Miles is nearly killed when the car has brake fade during testing. In 1966, Ford Senior Vice President Leo Beebe takes over the racing division, with the intent to continue the program without Miles, but Shelby gives Ford a ride in the car and wagers his own company to convince Ford to agree that if Miles wins the 24 Hours of Daytona, he will be allowed to race at Le Mans.\nShelby American enters Daytona, but Beebe has a second Ford entered with NASCAR team Holman-Moody supporting it. While the Holman-Moody team has quicker pit stops, Shelby has Miles push his car to the 7,000 RPM tachometer redline and he wins the race.\nAt the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans, Miles struggles with a faulty door during the first lap, but after team engineer Phil Remington fixes it with a mallet, Miles begins to set lap records while catching up to the Ferraris. While racing with Ferrari driver Lorenzo Bandini \u2013 piloting Ferrari's new prototype 330 P3 \u2013 Miles experiences brake failure and has his brake system replaced during his pit stop. Enzo Ferrari protests the move, but Shelby convinces race officials that the replacement is legal. Miles and Bandini once again duel on the Mulsanne Straight until Bandini blows his engine, eliminating the Ferrari from the race. With three Ford teams in the top positions, Beebe orders Shelby to have Miles slow down for the other two Fords to catch up with him and provide the press with a three-car photo finish. Miles is initially against this decision, continuing to set new lap records near the end of the race, but decides to let Ford have their way on the final lap. Ultimately, McLaren is declared the winner on a technicality, but Miles is grateful to Shelby for giving him the opportunity to race at Le Mans.\nTwo months after Le Mans, while testing the J-car at Riverside International Raceway, Miles once again experiences brake failure and is killed in the resulting crash. Six months later, Shelby pays Miles' widow Mollie and son Peter a visit and gives Peter a wrench that Miles threw at him before winning an SCCA race at Willow Springs in 1963.\nFord continued its winning streak at Le Mans in 1967, 1968, and 1969.

The Motorcycle Boy mentions that he located their long-lost mother during his recent trip while she was with a movie producer, which took him to California although he did not reach the ocean. Later, Steve and Rusty James wander drunkenly home, and are attacked by thugs, but both are saved by the Motorcycle Boy. As he nurses Rusty James again, the Motorcycle Boy tells him that the gang life and the rumbles he yearns for and idolizes are not what he believes them to be. Steve calls the Motorcycle Boy crazy, a claim which the Motorcycle Boy does not deny; further prompting Rusty James to believe his brother is insane, just like his runaway mother supposedly was.\nRusty James meets up with the Motorcycle Boy the next day in a pet store, where the latter is strangely fascinated with the Siamese fighting fish, which he refers to as \"rumble fish.\" Officer Patterson suspects they will try to rob the store. The brothers leave and meet their father, who explains to Rusty James that, contrary to popular belief, neither his mother nor brother are crazy, but rather they were both born with an acute perception. The brothers go for a motorcycle ride through the city and arrive at the Pet Store where the Motorcycle Boy breaks in and starts to set the animals loose. Rusty James makes a last-gasp effort to convince his brother to reunite with him, but the Motorcycle Boy refuses, explaining that the differences between them are too great for them to ever have the life Rusty James speaks of. The Motorcycle Boy takes the fish and rushes to free them in the river, but is fatally shot by Officer Patterson before he can. Rusty James, after hearing the gunshot, finishes his brother's last attempt while a large crowd of people converges on his body.\nRusty James finally reaches the Pacific Ocean (something the Motorcycle Boy failed to do) and enjoys the shining sun and flocks of birds flying around the beach. He also tries to forget what happened to his brother.", "title": "Rumble Fish", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q845102"}}

{"id": "tt3199240", "text": "Combining period archive materials with state-of-the-art special effects, The Great Martian War 1913\u20131917 features \"previously recorded\" interviews with now aging or dead war veterans while looking back at the entire sweep of the interplanetary conflict. The war begins in the depths of Germany's Bohemian Forest, following a massive explosion and shock wave that is felt by the rest of Europe. Elements of the German army are sent to investigate and are wiped out. The German government makes a panicked appeal for military assistance in fighting what turns out to be a powerful, non-human invading force thought to be from Mars.\nAs the conflict unfolds, the film showcases the devastation of Western Europe, where a rag-tag human alliance digs in against monstrous Martian fighting machines, unaware that deep flaws exist in their military leadership's central battle strategy. Across the Atlantic, the film outlines the political battle for the White House as President Woodrow Wilson struggles to maintain American isolationism, all the while sending aid and men to the beleaguered European alliance. From the skies over central London, where biplanes battle a towering alien tripod, to the war's catastrophic final act, the Allies, now standing on the brink of total defeat by the alien invaders, must decide if launching an untested and potentially devastating secret weapon is worth risking the lives of millions and causing a global pandemic.\nExploring the war's events are modern historians with opposing views about the conflict's many controversies. They most especially disagree on an incendiary new discovery by one of them centered around the uncrackable \"Martian Code\", a vast century old cache of alien documents seized following the conclusion of the war. These documents now appear to contain the direst of warnings that the war may only be paused, with its second act now unfolding in a way no one can anticipate.", "title": "The Great Martian War 1913 1917", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q18703145"}}

Diving instructor Anne Kimbrough's student is one of the victims, but her estranged police officer husband Steve refuses to let her see the corpse. The death is abnormal for the area and wildlife, which she knows as a former marine biologist. For her not to know what killed a diver is a dangerous sign. Soon after, two women and a man are killed by piranha which has developed the ability to fly.\nConcerned, Anne finds that she is being frequently bothered by tourist Tyler Sherman, so she takes him with her to the morgue to get a look at the body. A nurse comes in and kicks them out, unaware that a piranha was hiding in the body. It kills the nurse and escapes through a window.\nIn her hurry, Anne left her credit card behind at the scene. Anne and Tyler have a one-night stand. In the morning she begins to study the pictures of the corpse, and is horrified by what she discovers. Steve arrives, throwing the card at her, angry that she went to the morgue and that she has a man in her bed. She tries to warn him of what she has discovered, but he ignores her and thinks she is a murderess.\nAnne tries to tell the managers that she is canceling the dives because it is not safe. He at first pretends to be concerned, but quickly fires her, thinking she is crazy. Attempting to capture one for further study, or take pictures as proof, she is intercepted by Tyler, who informs her that he is a biochemist and member of a team which has developed the ultimate weapon: a specimen of genetically modified piranha, capable of flying. Earlier, and unfortunately, the team mistakenly deposited (or lost) a cylinder full of these fish in the water where the dead couple were found.\nGabby provides the proof Anne needs to Steve, calling him and showing him that they are a serious danger, as they are now eating each other, having devoured everything else. At a meeting, Anne tries her best to reason with the manager, to no avail. Steve provides a piranha wing as evidence. Steve tells her that she cannot trust Tyler, because the army says he is crazy. She argued that Tyler has just been using her to get the message of the piranha out for him, to protect both himself and the residents of the hotel.\nLater, a piranha attacks Gabby's son and kills him, leaving Gabby to vow revenge. Anne tries to dissuade him, but it is too late. Having ignored Anne's advice, the manager, Raoul, hosts a nighttime fish party to capture grunion. Unfortunately for the residents, the piranha join the hunt. Anne gets a man named Aaron to patrol the beach but he is lured to the sea where the piranha mutilate and kill him. During the fishing party promoted by the resort, the piranhas fly out of the water and attack the guests on the beach and at the hotel's courtyard pool. Anne leads those who survive into the hotel, where they shut the doors and windows. Gabby tries to attack the flying piranha, but they easily overwhelm and kill him, while the guests watch helplessly.\nIn the morning the piranha's leave as they do not like the light. Tyler and Anne decide to undertake Gabby's plan, and blow up the ship to destroy the predators. Meanwhile Anne and Steve's son Chris has been hired, against their wishes, by a local ship 'Captain' Dumont and his daughter Allison. They sail away and strand themselves on an island. Getting lost at sea, they try to set sail again, heading straight toward the wreck.\nWhen Chris and Allison are stranded in a raft above the shipwreck, Anne and Tyler arrive in a motorboat and dive down to the wreck to plant the timer charges that Gabby left behind. With only 10 minutes to get out of the wreck before the bomb explodes, Anne and Tyler are trapped in one of the sunken ships rooms by the murderous piranha who all return to the wreck. Steve, piloting a police helicopter, ditches the chopper and swims to Anne and Tyler's motorboat where Chris and Allison are. Steve powers up the boat and takes off. Down in the wreck Tyler becomes stuck and is eaten by the piranhas. Anne escapes out of a porthole, then grabs the anchor, allowing herself to be pulled away by the motorboat on the surface.

Louison proves to be a superb worker with a spectacular trick knife, and the butcher is reluctant to kill him too quickly. During Louison's routine maintenance, he acquires a package dropped by a mailman. Louison delivers the package to Clapet's daughter, Julie, who says the package contains confections and invites him to join her that evening. Louison and Julie's relationship blossoms into romance.  At the same time, several of the tenants fall under Louison's boyish charms, worrying others who are more anxious for their own safety should they require meat. \nClapet tells apartment tenant Marcel Tapioca that his rent is late and he must give up his mother-in-law as payment. That evening, Julie begs her father to let Louison go, knowing that Clapet is killing tenants for meat. She goes to her apartment, unwraps a newspaper in her refrigerator and sees an article about the Troglodistes, a group of vegetarian rebels who live underground. Julie descends into the sewers to make contact with the feared Troglodistes, whom she persuades to help rescue Louison.After the apparent butchering of Tapioca's mother-in-law, the Troglodistes go through the sewer pipes and attempt to capture Louison, but end up mistakenly capturing tenant Mademoiselle Plusse instead. Meanwhile, as Julie and Louison watch television, Clapet ascends to the roof, shaking the television antenna to lure Louison into going up to fix it. Attacking Louison with a cleaver, Clapet's attempt to kill him is foiled by an unexpected electrical explosion in one of the apartments.\nClapet, along with some sympathetic tenants, storms Louison's room in another attempt to murder him. Louison and Julie take refuge in a bathroom and flood it, floor to ceiling, until Clapet opens the door, releasing the flood and washing the attackers away. Mademoiselle Plusse escapes the sewers, finds Louison's boomerang knife, and gives it to Clapet. Clapet throws the knife towards Louison, but inadvertently kills himself.

Susanna had previously had an affair with Professor Gilcrest, an English instructor, as well as a casual relationship with a young man, Toby. In the psychiatric ward, Susanna befriends Polly Clark, a childlike schizophrenic; Georgina Tuskin, a pathological liar and Susanna's roommate; Daisy Randone, who self-harms and has obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder, as well as being implied to be bulimic; and Janet, a sardonic woman with anorexia. Susanna is particularly drawn to the sociopath Lisa Rowe, who is rebellious but charismatic and encourages Susanna to stop taking her medication and resist therapy. \nLisa helps the girls sneak around at night in the hospital's underground tunnels and continuously provokes them and the staff, including the stern head nurse, Valerie. Through regular therapy sessions with Dr. Melvin Potts, Susanna comes to learn she has borderline personality disorder, a fact Dr. Potts initially conceals from her. On a rare supervised group outing celebrating Daisy's impending release, the women visit an ice cream parlor in town. There, Susanna is confronted by Barbara Gilcrest, the wife of Professor Gilcrest, and their daughter, Bonnie. Barbara publicly chastises Susanna for sleeping with her husband; coming to Susanna's defense, Lisa insultingly berates Barbara and the other girls mock her and Bonnie before they both leave, humiliated. This endears Susanna to Lisa even more, though Valerie reprimands Lisa.\nOne day, Toby, who has been drafted to serve in the Vietnam War, visits Susanna, begging her to run away with him to Canada. Susanna tells him she has become friends with the other girls and would like to leave someday but not with him. That night, Polly has a breakdown and is placed in isolation. Susanna and Lisa drug the night watch nurse with a sedative and attempt to comfort Polly by singing to her. Susanna also makes out with John, one of the hospital orderlies who has a crush on her. When Valerie finds the group sleeping in the hallway in the morning, she punishes the two women, particularly Lisa, who is forced to endure electroshock therapy followed by solitary confinement.\nLater that night, Lisa manages to break out of confinement and convinces Susanna to escape with her. The women hitchhike to Daisy's newly-rented apartment, supplied by her doting father, and bribe her with valium to spend the night. Daisy, insistent she has been cured of her illness, is confronted by Lisa when Lisa discovers Daisy has been cutting herself. Lisa taunts Daisy, accusing her of enjoying the incestuous sexual abuse she has long suffered from her father. The next morning, Susanna finds Daisy dead in her bathroom, having slashed her wrists and hanged herself. Susanna is appalled when Lisa searches Daisy's room and body for cash. Realizing she does not want to become like Lisa, Susanna phones for an ambulance and returns to Claymoore while Lisa flees to Florida.\nBack at the hospital, Susanna occupies herself with painting and writing, and co-operates with her therapy, including regular sessions with the hospital's head psychologist, Dr. Sonia Wick. Before Susanna is released, Lisa is apprehended and returned to Claymoore. She steals Susanna's diary one night and reads it for the amusement of the patients in the tunnels, turning them against Susanna. After reading an entry in which Susanna feels sympathy for Lisa being a cold, dark person, Lisa attacks Susanna and chases her through the tunnels. Cornered, Susanna confronts Lisa, accusing her of being dead inside, emotionally dependent on Claymoore, and afraid of the world. This confrontation profoundly affects Lisa, who breaks down and contemplates suicide, though the others manage to dissuade her from doing so. Before Susanna is released the next day, she goes to visit Lisa, who is restrained to a bed.

In the chaos, Lilliana is fatally wounded and goes into labor; at his dying wife's urging, Frederick reluctantly performs a caesarean section to save their unborn daughter. \nYears later, the young Lilli Hoffman, named after her late mother, plays mischievously on the grounds of the Hoffman estate. Frederick remarries a noble woman named Lady Claudia. Despite Claudia's kindness to her, Lilli is resentful towards her new stepmother, not even thanking Claudia for her gift of a Rottweiler puppy. On the Hoffmans' wedding night, Lilli runs from her nursemaid and hides under Claudia's bed. However the nursemaid is mysteriously killed by an unseen force when she looks into Claudia's ornate wardrobe mirror, which was passed down from her mother, a practitioner of witchcraft.\n9 years later, Lilli has grown into a beautiful but self-centered young woman. She still resents Claudia, now pregnant with her first child, despite her best efforts to be kind to Lilli. The Hoffmans throw a ball to celebrate the impending birth of Frederick and Claudia's son. Claudia gives Lilli a gown to wear to the ball that belonged to her as a child. Lilli rebuffs the gift and rebels by wearing one of her own mother's gowns to the ball, directing all the guests' attention to her and away from Claudia. Frederick is first startled, then pleased at Lilli's evocation of her mother. As the two dance, a hurt and jealous Claudia becomes so distressed that she goes into an early labor and delivers a stillborn boy. Dr. Peter Gutenberg, the Hoffmans' physician, informs Frederick that the stillbirth has rendered Claudia infertile. Distraught, she is soon corrupted by the power of the mirror and swears revenge on Lilli. \nThe next morning, a remorseful and sympathetic Lilli attempts to make peace with Claudia, who appears to forgive her. Dr. Gutenberg proposes to Lilli, who happily accepts; he goes to ask for her father's consent. While waiting for him, she is confronted by Claudia's mute brother Gustav, who tries to kill her per Claudia's orders but she escapes deep into the woods. Gustav then resorts to killing a boar instead and presents its heart to Claudia, who orders him to place the rest of the remains in the stew pot intended for the Hoffmans' dinner, which she later eats with wicked relish.  However, when she coughs up the boar's blood, she realizes that Gustav has failed her. Enraged at his betrayal, she bewitches Gustav, which causes him to have horrific hallucinations that drive him to suicide.  Frederick and the household search for Lilli in the woods, but Frederick falls from his horse and is injured. \nIn the meantime, Lilli is found by seven rough, combative miners, led by Will, who grudgingly take her under their wing. One of them attempts to rape Lilli, but is stopped by Will and thrown out. Claudia makes another attempt on Lilli's life using witchcraft to crush her in the mines, but Lilli escapes and one of the miners is killed instead. Dr. Gutenberg returns to the castle to find it almost abandoned save for Claudia, who, in an attempt to get rid of him, seduces and pleads with him to find Lilli.\nClaudia again uses witchcraft to lure Lilli to her death by summoning a gale to knock down the trees and crush her to death. Lilli is almost crushed when she tries to save one of the miners Lars, but she is pulled to safety by Will and Lars is killed. One of the miners spots a raven that had been following them and kills it after realizing it was bewitched. Under the mirror's influence, Claudia decides to deal with Lilli later and focuses on resurrecting her dead son in a ritual that requires her to \"steal the father's seed and bathe the child in the father's blood\". She then makes her way to the injured Frederick's bedchamber and rapes him. In the forest, while the four remaining miners mourn their losses, Lilli notices Will's scars, inflicted by Crusaders. Having fallen in love, the two share a kiss. \nClaudia disguises herself as a crone and turns her brother's eviscerated heart into a poisoned apple. Transported to Lilli's refuge, she deceives her into accepting the apple, which puts her into a deathlike state. Will finds Lilli seemingly dead on the ground from a bite of the apple. Dr. Gutenberg eventually finds them and sadly pronounces her dead. The miners place her in a glass coffin and prepare to bury her. Will notices that her eyes have opened and pulls Lilli's body from the coffin, shaking her as he commands her to breathe, dislodging the piece of apple that had been stuck in her throat. In the castle, Claudia takes Frederick to the chapel, ties him to a crucifix and suspends it upside down, preparing to exsanguinate him to complete the resurrection of her son. \nGutenberg takes Lilli back to the castle to stop Claudia and rescue Frederick, followed by Will. On arriving, they discover that the entire household has been placed under a spell, rendering them mindless and feral. They find a weak and delirious Frederick, who believes Lilli to be a ghost, and Will takes him outside to safety. Claudia kills Gutenberg by pushing him out a window. \nLilli then finds Claudia cradling her newly revived but weak baby. The two engage in a fight, during which Claudia slams Lilli's head into a mirror and sadistically cuts her face with one of the shards. When Lilli accidentally sets the room alight, Claudia becomes distracted by her son's distress.  This allows Lilli to grab a dagger and stab the mirror wounding both Claudia and her reflection. Claudia removes the dagger from the mirror and is horrified to see that her appearance has been reduced to that of an old woman. The mirror then cracks and shatters to pieces; shards of glass go flying in Claudia\u2019s face, causing her to accidentally step backwards into the path of the fire, setting her ablaze and killing her. Lilli then joins Will and Frederick outside. Her father finally comes to and is overjoyed to see her again.

{"id": "tt0120844", "text": "Lieutenant Commander Data (Brent Spiner) is temporarily transferred to an undercover mission observing the peaceful Ba'ku people. While on their planet, he malfunctions and reveals the presence of the joint Federation\u2013Son'a task force observing the Ba'ku. Admiral Matthew Dougherty (Anthony Zerbe) contacts the USS Enterprise-E to obtain Data's schematics for recovery purposes but adamantly states the presence of the Enterprise is not needed. The crew decides to ignore these orders and takes the Enterprise to capture Data. Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) becomes suspicious of Dougherty's insistence that the Enterprise is no longer needed and orders the cause of Data's malfunction to be investigated. The crew discovers that the Ba'ku possess advanced technology, but have rejected its use to live simpler lives. Due to unique \"metaphasic particles\" emanating from their planet's rings, they are effectively immortal. By contrast, the Federation's allies, the Son'a, are a decrepit race who rely on medical technology to prevent death; their excessive use of cosmetic surgery gives them a mummified appearance. The Enterprise crew also begin to experience the rejuvenation effects of the planet: Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) finds his eyes have regenerated and he no longer requires ocular implants, Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) rekindle their long-abandoned relationship, and Picard develops a romantic relationship with the Ba'ku woman Anij (Donna Murphy).\nData and Picard discover a submerged and cloaked Federation ship containing a gigantic holodeck set up to recreate the Ba'ku home village. Data's malfunction stems from a Son'a attack, the result of his accidental discovery of the vessel. Picard confronts Dougherty and learns that top Federation officers colluded with the Son'a to deceptively move the Ba'ku to the ship and forcibly relocate them to another planet, allowing for the particles to be collected on a mass scale (poisoning the planet in the process). Dougherty orders the Enterprise to leave. Picard retorts that the medical benefits of the particles does not justify Dougherty's plans for the Ba'ku and violates the Prime Directive.\nPicard is joined by some of his crew to help the Ba'ku escape from being abducted while Riker takes the Enterprise to transmission range so he can communicate the violation to Starfleet. The Son'a send robotic probes to locate and capture the fleeing Ba'ku. The Son'a leader, Ahdar Ru'afo (F. Murray Abraham), convinces Dougherty to allow two Son'a ships to attack the Enterprise. Riker defeats the attacking ships and the Enterprise escapes. Their plan exposed, Ru'afo insists upon harvesting the radiation source immediately. Picard, Anij, and several Ba'ku are transported as prisoners onto the Son'a ship. Picard reveals to Dougherty that the Son'a and the Ba'ku are the same race: The Son'a are a splinter faction of Ba'ku who gave up their bucolic existence a century earlier to embrace the use of technology. They attempted to seize power but failed, and the Ba'ku elders exiled them from the planet, denying them the rejuvenating effects of the rings. The Son'a developed an artificial and imperfect means to extend their lives at the cost of disfigurement, and now seek revenge. Ru'afo kills Dougherty when he backs out of the plan and moves to finish the collection.\nWhile Picard is prepped for execution, he convinces the disillusioned Son'a Gallatin (Gregg Henry) to help him stop Ru'afo. Picard masterminds a ruse to transport Ru'afo and his bridge crew to the holoship and disable the harvester. Ru'afo discovers the deception and transports to the harvester ship to manually restart the process. Picard follows and sets the harvester to self-destruct, killing Ru'afo and escaping on the Enterprise. The remaining Son'a are forgiven and welcomed back by the Ba'ku. Picard arranges a meeting between Gallatin and his Ba'ku mother to thank him for his help.

{"id": "tt0045883", "text": "In 1870, at a remote ranch in Arizona, homesteader Angie Lowe (Geraldine Page) and her six-year-old son Johnny (Lee Aaker) are performing chores at their ranch when a stranger (John Wayne) arrives on foot, carrying only his saddle bags and a rifle. The man tells them that his name is Lane, and that he was riding dispatch for the US Army Cavalry. He had lost his horse in an encounter with some Indians. Angie tells Lane her ranch hand had quit before he had a chance to break her two horses for riding, so Lane offers to break a horse himself. Lane deduces from the neglected ranch that her husband has been away for some time, a fact she confesses is true. When night falls Angie offers to let Lane sleep in her home. Hondo, meanwhile, reveals that he is part Indian and was married five years to a Mescalero woman. Angie sees his rifle is inscribed \"Hondo\" Lane, who she knows had killed three men the year before. She attempts to shoot him but the chamber is empty, so Hondo is not hurt. He loads the chamber and tells her to keep it that way. Hondo tells Angie she reminds him of a woman from his past, and kisses her before he leaves.\nAt the ranch, Angie and Johnny are beset by Apaches, led by Chief Vittoro (Michael Pate) and his main under-chief Silva (Rodolfo Acosta). Angie is not nervous in their presence as they have never attacked her family before. This time, they begin manhandling Angie. Johnny emerges from the house with the pistol and shoots at Silva. As Silva recovers and approaches him, he throws the pistol at Silva. Vittoro is impressed by Johnny's bravery and makes him an Apache blood brother. Vittoro wonders where Angie's husband is and tells her that unless he returns soon, she must take an Apache husband as the boy needs a father.\nHondo returns to his Cavalry post, where he meets up with his friend Buffalo Baker (Ward Bond). He reports to his commanding officer that C Troop, which was sent to gather and bring in settlers to the north, was killed by Apaches. It is clear to the Major (Paul Fix) that the Apaches are raiding and killing settlers. In a saloon, Hondo gets into a fight with a stranger, and beats him severely. Baker tells Hondo the man called himself \"Ed Lowe\" (Leo Gordon), and Hondo suspects he is Angie's husband. Meanwhile, Vittoro shows Angie some prospective husbands from among his men. She insists she is still married, and he gives her a deadline: if her husband does not return by the time of the planting rain, she must take an Apache husband.\nFeeling guilty, Hondo leaves to return Angie's horse. Lowe and a guide (Frank McGrath) follow Hondo, who camps near a river but leaves when he detects two Indians stalking him. Lowe enters the camp and he and his guide are attacked by the two Indians. The guide is killed, but Hondo shoots the Apache about to kill Lowe. Lowe is briefly grateful but as he lies on the ground and is preparing to shoot Hondo in the back in retaliation for the beating, the more experienced Hondo spins around and quickly shoots him to save his own life. Hondo finds a tin type of Johnny on Lowe's body, confirming his identity.\nHondo runs into an Apache party, and is captured. They torture him to get information about the Cavalry when Vittoro appears. An Indian shows Vittoro the picture of Johnny, and Vittoro assumes Hondo is Angie's husband. Silva declares the blood rite as Hondo had killed his brother. In a one on one knife fight setup to settle the feud, Silva stabs Hondo in the shoulder, but Hondo pins Silva to the ground, and gives him the option to take back the blood rite or die. Silva gives in. Vittoro takes Hondo to Angie's ranch, and when Vittoro asks if Hondo is her husband, she lies, saving Hondo. The Chief warns Hondo to raise Johnny in the Apache way and leaves. Before the Apache party leaves, Silva ultimately gets his revenge against Hondo by killing his dog, Sam, and leaving the body in front of the porch as a message to Hondo that their feud is not over.\nHondo and Angie grow close as he recuperates. Hondo attempts to reveal the truth of her husband's death, but is interrupted by Vittoro's return. The chief tells them that the pony soldiers will soon return. He asks Hondo not to join them and to keep the Indians' location a secret by telling a lie. Hondo promises to do the former but not the latter, and Vittoro shows respect for Hondo's truthfulness. Angie tells Hondo she loves him.\nThe Army arrives at the ranch, commanded by ambitious but inexperienced Lt. McKay (Tom Irish) and accompanied by scouts Baker and Lennie (James Arness). McKay is determined to protect the settlers in the area by relocating them to the Army post and defend the area against Apache attacks. Lennie reveals he discovered Lowe's body and matched the horse tracks to Hondo's horse. He wants Hondo's Winchester rifle in exchange for keeping quiet about how Hondo apparently bushwhacked Lowe. Angie overhears Lennie's demands.\nHondo prepares to leave, but before he goes, he tells Angie the truth about her husband's death. Hondo also wants to tell Johnny, but she persuades him not to, telling Hondo she didn't love her husband any longer. She says it would be unkind to tell the boy the truth of his father's death and that the secret won't follow them to Hondo's ranch in California. Hondo responds to her emotional plea with an Indian word that seals a squaw-seeking ceremony, \"Varlabania\", which he tells her means \"forever\". The Army leaves to move further on into Apache territory. As promised, Hondo refuses to go with them, but tells Buffalo that McKay is leading them into a massacre. Buffalo knows, but he also knows that scouts such as he have been helping to train young West Point officers for many years.\nThe Army returns causing the Apaches to retreat. Realizing the danger they are in Hondo, Angie and Johnny join the Cavalry and head to the fort. The column is attacked by the Apaches, and form a wagon circle that barely holds together. Amidst a chaotic counterattack to save some stragglers, Hondo loses his mount and is attacked by Silva, but amidst the dust Hondo kills him. The Indians then retreat. Lt. McKay says that General Crook will be arriving in the territory with a large force. \"Buffalo\" Baker says it will be the end of the Apache. Hondo proclaims \"Yeah. End of a way of life. Too bad, it's a good way.\" The movie ends with the idea that once back to the fort, Hondo, Angie and Johnny will continue on to Hondo's ranch in California as a family.", "title": "Hondo (film)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q1888547"}}

Tophet\u2014(Tophet is a Hebrew word for \"Hell\") is a lively character, taking pleasure in petty acts of PG-rated malice, such as making a waiter fall into a pool.\nThe movie tells the story of a struggling rock musician/songwriter, Bobby Shelton (played by Wass), who cannot get a break. Bobby, desperate to support his wife, Wendy (Roxanne Hart), and start a family, muses that he would sell his soul to the devil to get ahead. The devil begins to appear to Bobby as a prospective agent called Harry O. Tophet and offers Shelton a deal\u2014seven years of unprecedented fame and fortune. Shelton balks at the deal and so Tophet renegotiates claiming that it will be for a \"trial period\", urging Bobby to leave his earnest agent Charlie (Eugene Roche).

As such, his family is now someone else's\u2014the former Billy Wayne, whose life Tophet now controls and who has assumed Bobby's identity. He also discovers that his wife is pregnant with his child.

God appears after Bobby has \"the Lord\" paged in a hotel lobby and offers to help.\nDuring a climactic poker game between God and the devil over Bobby's soul, God raises the stakes while Bobby under Tophet's machinations attempts suicide. God claims that if he loses, in addition to Bobby's soul, he will stop protecting all those on \"his list\". If God wins, the devil would be prevented from meddling with any of those on the list, even if they beg for his assistance. Considering the loss too high, Tophet folds, and finds that God had been bluffing, winning by, in God's words, \"I put the fear of ME in YOU.\", and that part of the reason he had intervened for Bobby was because the devil had become too arrogant and cocky.\nBobby rises from the floor of the dressing room and slips away as staffers discover the corpse of Billy Wayne, who had committed suicide.

{"id": "tt1253864", "text": "After a race of immortal beings waged war on each other for ten years, the Twelve Olympians emerged victorious, ruling on Mount Olympus and vanquishing the previous generation of ruling gods, the Titans, to imprisonment beneath Mount Tartarus. During the war, the Epirus Bow, a mighty weapon capable of shooting invincible arrows of energy, fell to Earth and was lost.\nIn 1228 BC, King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke) of Heraklion mounts a campaign to recover the Epirus Bow and free the Titans, bitter over the death of his family from disease and determined to destroy the gods who refused his prayers that his family be spared. In search of the virgin oracle, whose prophetic visions he intends on using to find the Bow, Hyperion subjugates the Sibylline monastery, capturing a monk (Mark Margolis) who cuts off his own tongue to prevent himself from divulging the oracle's identity. His efforts prove futile, however, when Hyperion discovers the oracle to be Phaedra (Freida Pinto), imprisoning her and her attendants, before laying waste to nearby villages.\nTo escape Hyperion's army, the inhabitants of one of the villages prepare to flee to Mount Tartarus, Theseus (Henry Cavill), a stonemason, and his mother Aethra (Anne Day-Jones) among them. Despite his skill as a warrior, having been trained in combat by his mentor (John Hurt), a mysterious old man, both mother and son are outcasts in their village, regarded as undesirables due to Theseus being a product of his mother's rape. Forced to stay behind in the village by Lysander (Joseph Morgan), a cruel Athenian soldier, Theseus begins to fight for his and his mother's life, until the army's general, Helios (Peter Stebbings), intervenes and discharges Lysander from the army. Seeking vengeance, Lysander travels to Hyperion to offer him his services, revealing the location of Theseus's village. Hyperion accepts Lysander's offer, but scars his face to mark his treachery and crushes his testicles to prevent him fathering more cowards like himself.\nThe old man meets with the goddess Athena (Isabel Lucas) and the gods Poseidon (Kellan Lutz), Ares (Daniel Sharman), Apollo (Corey Sevier), and Heracles (Steve Byers), revealing himself to be Zeus (Luke Evans), the king of the gods, in disguise. Zeus warns the others to refrain from interfering in mortal affairs, unless the Titans are released from their prison, and urges them to have trust in mankind's ability to defeat Hyperion.\nHyperion's forces attack Theseus's village, with Aethra among the slain villagers. Theseus is taken captive, where he is imprisoned alongside Phaedra and her attendants. After touching Theseus, Phaedra has a vision of him as either the savior of humanity or as Hyperion's ally in the destruction of the world. That night, she and her attendants seduce and kill the guards. Phaedra escapes with Theseus, along with the mute monk and two slaves, Stavros (Stephen Dorff) and Dareios (Alan van Sprang). Theseus decides to pursue Hyperion and attempts to capture one of his ships, but is quickly defeated by Hyperion's men. In an effort to save Theseus, Poseidon dives into the ocean from Mount Olympus, creating an enormous tsunami that wipes out the opposing forces.\nAfter having a vision of a shrouded body which she believes to be Theseus's mother, Phaedra tells him that he must return to his village and properly bury Aethra, reasoning that even though he doesn't believe in the gods, his mother was deeply faithful. While laying Aethra to rest in the village's labyrinth, Theseus discovers the Epirus Bow embedded in a nearby rock. He frees the Bow, but is attacked by Hyperion's forces and his powerful henchman, the Minotaur (Robert Maillet). Dareios is killed by the soldiers, but Theseus manages to defeat the Minotaur and uses the Bow to save the others from being executed, before collapsing from the Minotaur's venomous scratches. As Phaedra tends to Theseus's wounds, the two fall in love. They spend the night together, and Phaedra is freed of the prophetic visions which she had thought herself cursed by.\nThe following day, the group returns to the Sibylline monastery where they are lured into an ambush, with a jackal stealing the Epirus Bow from Theseus and bringing it to Hyperion. Vastly outnumbered by Hyperion's men, Ares intervenes to save Theseus's life. Enraged at Ares for disobeying his orders, Zeus kills him. He allows Athena to provide the group with horses to reach Mount Tartarus, so that they can stand against Hyperion's forces, but warns the humans and gods alike that there will be no more divine intervention. Before leaving with Athena, Zeus entreats Theseus to prove him right and justify the faith he has in him alone.\nTheseus, Stavros, and Phaedra travel to Mount Tartarus where Theseus tries to warn Cassander (Stephen McHattie), the king of the Hellenes, of Hyperion's plans. His talk of the gods is dismissed by an unbelieving Cassander, who instead plans on negotiating peace with Hyperion. The following day, Hyperion uses the Epirus Bow to destroy the gates of Mount Tartarus, freeing the Titans from their prison, and prompting Zeus and the other Olympians to intervene. Meanwhile, Theseus leads the Hellenic army to war against the Hyperion forces, killing Lysander in battle. The massive force unleashed by the Titans's release knocks Stavros into a vault. Trapped, he retrieves the Bow and manages to kill one of the Titans, buying Theseus time to get to safety, before being killed by the other Titans. Theseus manages to kill Hyperion, sustaining mortal injuries in the process, and Zeus destroys the Epirus Bow. Overwhelmed by the sheer number of the Titans, all of the gods, except for Zeus and Poseidon, are killed. In an effort to imprison the Titans once more, Zeus destroys Mount Tartarus, with the collapsing mountain trapping the Titans and crushing the remnants of Hyperion's army. He then retrieves Athena's body and ascends to Olympus with a badly wounded Poseidon. For his sacrifice, Theseus is transported to Olympus, where he is given a place amongst the gods.\nSeveral years later, Theseus's story has become one of legend. Phaedra lives in Theseus's old village where she raises their son, Acamas (Gage Munroe), who has inherited her gift of prophecy. Zeus, in his guise of an old man, approaches the boy and tells him to prepare for a coming war against evil, and to not fear his visions.

During intercourse, she notices an egg encased in a glass tube with a face painted on it. Stitches explains that \"they\" made him do it when he signed up. Stitches arrives late at Tommy's tenth birthday party. He attempts to entertain the children, but they instead ridicule him. Tommy's best friend Vinnie ties Stitches' shoelaces together, and Tommy throws a soccer ball on his face, causing him to trip and land on a kitchen knife on the other side of the room, unseen to the children, which penetrates his face. As the children come to find out, Stitches slowly gets up, revealing the knife lodged in his eye. Stitches stares at the kids and makes raspy breathing. Seeing him, all of the kids scream in terror and run away. However, Tommy stays; when Stitches removes the knife, blood gushes out of his head. After it stops bleeding, he attempts to stab Tommy, only to slip on a puddle of blood. Stitches falls on the floor as the knife falls into his eye a second time, killing him. Tommy visits Stitches' grave to put a squeaky flower on top, only to find a group of clowns entering an abandoned building. Tommy enters the building to find the clowns performing a ritual with Stitches' egg. One member discovers Tommy and brings him to the cult's leader, The Motley. The Motley warns to Tommy that a clown who dies and never finishes the party will never rest in peace, and a joke is not as funny the second time.\nSix years later, Tommy is preparing for his sixteenth birthday.

Ultimately, he settles on a large gathering, and Vinnie secretly distributes many more invitations over the Internet.

Nearly killed by the surviving leader, Rosaria (Jennifer Gatti), Alex resists her assertion that he is a mindless robot: \"Eighty-six point five percent [of him] is still human.\"\nAfter months of cybernetic reconstruction and recovery, Alex tracks Rosaria to Old Baja and kills her. Soon after this, his handlers show up\u2014his former lover Jared (Marjorie Monaghan), who is an android, and another android, Sam. Alex decides he has had enough and leaves the LAPD, becoming a freelance hustler and triggerman. However, his LAPD bosses are just letting him run free for a while. After he is shot and badly wounded on a job, his old boss, Commissioner Farnsworth (Tim Thomerson), has him kidnapped and brought in for one final assignment. According to Germaine (Nicholas Guest), Jared has stolen vital security information regarding an upcoming summit between Japan and the United States, and must be stopped before she leaks the plans to the Red Army Hammerheads. Alex is told by Farnsworth that a bomb was implanted in his heart during his latest repairs. He is given three days to find Jared before she meets with the leader of the Hammerheads, Angie-Liv (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa); otherwise, the bomb will detonate and kill him. After flying to the island of Shang-Lu in the Pacific Rim, he is turned loose as bait for Jared.\nIn reality, the freedom fighters are not battling against government control of people's lives, but for humanity's future. A newly designed android is infiltrating the higher echelons of human society, copying the minds of powerful leaders into synthetic bodies, Farnsworth among them. Jared threatens their plans, and so Alex's real mission is to smoke her out for the synthetics to destroy. Burnt out, Alex halfheartedly begins his search, checking into a local hotel. He is soon intercepted by Julian (Deborah Shelton), a cyborg representing Jared. She tells him he is being followed by an LAPD strike team led by Farnsworth, waiting for the opportunity to hit the Hammerheads and Jared.\nIt turns out that Jared was fatally wounded in her escape from LA, requiring her memory core to be salvaged from her body. After removing a surveillance device implanted in Alex's eye, Julian injects him with a digital scrambler that prevents the bomb from being remotely detonated. She gives him Jared's memory core, enabling him to talk to her. The strike team storms the hotel and Julian sacrifices herself to allow Alex to escape.\nAlex eventually joins up with a local woman, Max (Merle Kennedy) who acts a scout for the Hammerheads while fronting as a tour guide. She is also the sister of Rosaria, the woman he had killed in Old Baja. While she wants Alex dead, her loyalty to the freedom fighters comes first. He is brought to the Hammerheads and is convinced by Angie-Liv to join their cause. Unfortunately, the strike team tracks them down, leading to a shootout and chase through the rundown city. Most of the Hammerheads, including Angie-Liv, are killed by Farnsworth's men. Alex saves Max's life, eventually earning her forgiveness. In a confrontation with Farnsworth, Alex shoots him with a grenade launcher, apparently killing him.\nAlex and Max arrive at a secret hangar where Yoshiro (Yuji Okumoto), a surviving Hammerhead, is waiting. While launching their escape vehicle, an aerodyne, they are attacked by the cyborg Farnsworth, reduced to his mechanical endoskeleton. Alex defeats him, but suffers grave injuries in the process and discovers just how much of him really is synthetic. Alex brings Jared's core to another Hammerhead compound where they will be able to destroy the labs being used to duplicate people.

{"id": "tt3448226", "text": "Immediately after committing his rampage in Tenderville, Oregon, Bill Williamson disappeared and had been living off the grid for years with the money he stole from a bank during the massacre. The video recording of his rants about violent population control had since garnered millions of views and turns Bill into an Internet sensation. In the present day, Bill uses the stolen money to finance yet another killing spree, purchasing a number of weapons, including two fully automatic, military-grade Mk 18 Mod 0 carbines, and constructing homemade explosives. After making final preparations for the killing spree, Bill shaves his head clean, dons his suit of body armor, and sets the interior of his house on fire. He drives to an alleyway and uses its cover to shoot several random pedestrians undetected, before trying to enter a bingo hall, only to leave after finding it is closed.\nBill then travels to a television station in Washington, D.C., where he blows up his car and enters the building. Inside, he shoots the security guard and several employees with the carbines. He then holds the survivors, including news anchorman Chip Parker, hostage and forces them to a basement at gunpoint. He kills one of the hostages when he disregards one of his orders. Bill later gives Chip a disc and instructs him to go upstairs and air the contents of the disc nationwide, then return with a camera crew so they could do a live interview with him. Chip agrees and leaves the basement, where he relays his instructions to the responding police officers. However, while trying to air the disc, he accidentally slips and breaks it. He returns to the basement and tells Bill what had happened, and an agitated Bill gives him a duplicate of the disc.\nWhile Chip is gone, Bill criticizes one of the hostages for her personal life before killing her. He is then confronted by another hostage, who reveals herself to be the sister of one of the people he killed at Tenderville. When she expresses her intent to kill him, Bill forces a reluctant male hostage to beat her. Eventually, the contents of the disc are aired on live television; in it, Bill rants in a video recording about how the current system is flawed and that the U.S. government is manipulating American citizens and events for the sake of wealth. The video ends with Bill appealing to the American people to retaliate violently against politicians and the wealthy in order to restore society. Meanwhile, the officers manage to contact Bill's father with the intention of using him to appeal to Bill.\nChip returns to the basement with a camera crew, including an undercover police officer, and gives Bill a cellphone with his father on the other end. Mr. Williamson tries to appeal to Bill, then reveals his mother died after a car accident, as a result of medication she had been taking for depression following Bill's first killing spree and disappearance. At that moment, Bill becomes suspicious of the undercover officer and kills him, then abruptly ends the conversation with his father. Using hidden security cameras he implanted earlier, he notices SWAT teams converging on the basement and remotely detonates explosives, killing or incapacitating the officers. At Chip's urging, Bill commences with the live interview, during which he becomes more specific about his rants in the disc and also espouses his opinions about killing innocent people. Asked if he regrets not being there when his mother died, he gets visibly upset but replies that his aim is bigger than family, and that it is about the survival of humanity. He then reveals his intention to die along with Chip before shooting him in the arm and releasing the other hostages.\nBill immediately engages a SWAT team in a shootout before fleeing into the building's ventilation system, leaving behind a gas bomb. Just as the SWAT team discovers the bomb, it detonates, destroying the entire station and killing 128 everyone inside, including Chip and the officers. Bill is then shown to be alive and well, watching a report of the station's destruction on his phone. As he does this, he spots a young girl reading a book and criticizes her for reading one telling her she's been brainwashed with lies by the system.

Out of hunger, Sinbad's men try to break open a Roc egg, causing it to hatch, but the newborn chick is killed by the men and roasted for food. While the men are eating, Parisa enters the magic lamp and befriends Barani, the childlike Genie inside, who tells her how to summon him in exchange for her promise of his freedom. The parent Roc returns and slays the men. Sinbad tries to summon the genie, but he is grabbed by the Roc, who takes flight, and drops him, unconscious, into its nearby nest. Sokurah kills Harufa and abducts the princess, taking her to his underground fortress.\nSinbad awakens and rubs the magic lamp, summoning Barani, who takes Sinbad to Sokurah's fortress and helps him evade the chained dragon that stands guard. Sinbad reaches Sokurah, who restores the princess to normal. When Sinbad refuses to hand over the lamp, the magician animates a skeleton warrior, which Sinbad fights and destroys. With the help of the genie, Sinbad and Parisa make their way out of the cave, stopping to destroy the lamp by throwing it into a pool of lava, thus freeing Barani.\nLeaving the cave, they encounter another cyclops. Sinbad releases the dragon, which fights and kills the creature. Sinbad and Parisa make their escape, but Sokurah orders the dragon to hunt them down. Sinbad heads to the beach, where his men have readied the giant crossbow, and they use it to kill the dragon. The dying dragon collapses on Sokurah, crushing him to death. Sinbad, Parisa, and the remaining crew depart for Baghdad. They are joined by Barani, now human, who has appointed himself as Sinbad's cabin boy. In a final act of magic as he was being freed, Barani filled the captain's cabin with the treasure from the cyclops' cave, a wedding gift to Sinbad and Parisa.", "title": "The 7th Voyage of Sinbad", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q1545331"}}

Eugen thinks she is screwy and Krista as well can only think that her mother - who has been a widow for years - is fantasizing.\nThe first real threat to their relationship comes with a visit by the landlord's son, who has been sent on the assumption that Emmi has taken in a lodger to point out to her that sub-letting is against Emmi's tenancy agreement, and that Ali must leave within a day.\nImpulsively, and fearful of losing this new joy in her life, Emmi claims that she and Ali are planning to marry to alleviate this little difficulty.\nThis changes everything for the landlord's son, the only character in the film who consistently accepts their relationship as unproblematic.\nAfter he has apologized for the misapprehension and departed, Emmi speaks to Ali with embarrassment of her having invented the idea of their marrying but, to her surprise and delight, Ali concurs that it is an excellent idea, and we next see them emerging from the civil court, married.\nWhat follows is a bitter and noxious reaction over their relationship, revealing every character in their lives, especially every German in Emmi's former life, as being mired in prejudice against foreign workers as dirty and now castigating Emmi as a \"whore\".\nGossipy neighbors and shop vendors treat them with contempt, fellow tenants complaining that their (already noticeably dilapidated) tenement building has now become filthy.\nEmmi is shunned by her coworkers, and Ali faces discrimination at every turn.\nWhen Emmi, whose first husband was a Polish worker whom she married against her Hitler-loving father's wishes, invites her three grown children and son-in-law to meet her husband, they openly reject him.\nOne of her sons smashes in her TV set in anger, her other son declares she must have lost her sanity, and her daughter and son-in-law follow them in making a rude and hasty exit, Emmi's daughter now calling her mother's apartment a \"pigsty\" and her mother a \"whore\".\nEmmi's tearful despair at this ultimate rejection washes away as her bright optimist resurfaces and concludes that she and Ali should take a long vacation together to escape the discrimination, convinced that upon return, they will have been missed and will be welcomed back.\nAfter their return, they suddenly face the prospect of social acceptance but, as we quickly see, only because neighboring tenants and shopkeepers see the utility for them in keeping Emmi in their good graces, not because they have changed their prejudices, thus we witness them hypocritically masking the latter out of self-interest.\nOut of longing to hang on to this resumption of her old friends' apparent renewed respect, Emmi begins to neglect Ali or to adopt some of their attitudes toward him.\nShe becomes very \"German\" - more readily ordering him to do things.\nWhen co-workers visit and remark on how surprisingly clean he is and comment on his muscles, she shows him off as if he were an object.\nThis is the trigger for Ali to exit, with our sympathy as viewers, and to seek comfort in the arms of the female bartender Barbara (Barbara Valentin), with whom he has apparently had dalliances prior to meeting Emmi.\nWhen he leaves Emmi to her friends, she attributes it to his \"mood swings,\" and notes that it must be his \"foreigner mentality\", adopting the xenophobic attitudes of her friends in order to fit in.\nSome days later, Emmi would not cook Ali couscous or go out with him to eat couscous somewhere either, symbolizing her re-Germanification and her own new wall built up against the sensitivity to foreigners she displayed at the outset, she insists she wants him to eat German food, and generally become more German so they would fit in.\nWe see Ali not stand up to Emmi because of the insecurities he faces as a hybrid.\nHe has accepted the German society's mentality that he is the \"lesser\" man.\nHe then turns back to the bartender, who used to cook for him, and spends the night with her.\nEmmi grows desperate at his being out all night and visits him at work, where he pretends he doesn't know her as his workmates make fun of her age, calling her Ali's \"Moroccan grandmother\".\nJust when it seems as if the relationship is beyond repair, Emmi goes back to the bar to meet with Ali and has the bartender put the same song on the jukebox that led to their first-ever dance.\nHe responds to the implicit call for reconciliation from Emmi and asks her to dance again.\nWhile dancing, Emmi emphasizes that she knows she is old and that he is free to come and go, but urges him to see that the only thing that\u2019s important is that when they are together, they must be nice to each other.\nHe agrees and they declare their love for each other.\nIn this moment, Ali collapses in Emmi's arms from what turns out to be a burst stomach ulcer.\nWe last see Emmi with Ali in the hospital, where the doctor tells her the illness is common among foreign workers because of the stress they face in everyday life; the doctor adds that Ali will have surgery to remove the ulcer, but will probably be back in 6 months with another ulcer.\nEmmi declares that she will do everything in her power to prevent this and, as the film ends, she is at his bedside, holding Ali's hand.", "title": "Ali: Fear Eats the Soul", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q543810"}}

Amber's mother, Velma, manages the show\u2019s host station WYZT, ensuring that Amber is prominently featured. Corny Collins and the other dancers are white, and Velma only allows African-American dancers once a month on \"Negro Day\", hosted by R&B disc jockey Motormouth Maybelle.\nOne of the dancers on the show, Brenda, takes a nine-month leave of absence, and auditions for a replacement are held. Tracy attends, but Velma rejects her based on her weight and for supporting integration. Tracy is given detention for missing class to attend the audition, and finds the \"Negro Day\" kids practicing in the detention room. She befriends Seaweed, Motormouth Maybelle's son, who teaches her dance moves. Link sees Tracy dancing and encourages her to attend a record hop with the dancers from the show; she is enchanted and imagines a life with him. At the record hop, Tracy's moves attract Corny's attention, and he chooses her to be on the show.\nTracy quickly becomes a popular performer, affecting both Amber's chances of winning the show's annual Miss Teenage Hairspray pageant and her relationship with Link, as he grows fonder of Tracy. A local boutique owner named Mr. Pinky suggests that Tracy should be the spokesgirl for his store, the Hefty Hideaway, and Tracy persuades her agoraphobic mother, Edna, to accompany her there as her agent. The outing boosts Edna\u2019s confidence, but it is shattered when they encounter Velma and Amber, who insult both of them for their size.\nTracy introduces Link and Penny to Seaweed, and he and Penny instantly connect. Seaweed and his younger sister Little Inez, a talented dancer, later take Tracy, Penny and Link to a party at Maybelle's store. Edna finds Tracy there and tries to take her home, but Maybelle convinces her to stay and tells her to take pride in herself. At the party, Maybelle informs everyone that Velma has canceled \"Negro Day\", and Tracy suggests that they march for integration. Link is unwilling to jeopardize his career by marching, straining his relationship with Tracy. Edna returns to her husband Wilbur's practical joke device shop, but Velma is there trying to seduce him. Edna accuses Wilbur of infidelity and forbids Tracy to be on the show out of hatred for Velma; however, she soon reconciles with Wilbur.\nThe next morning, Tracy sneaks out of the house to join the protest, which is halted by a police roadblock. Tracy argues with a police officer, and sparks a brawl when she unintentionally hits him with her sign. Tracy escapes to the Pingletons' home, where Penny helps her hide in their fallout shelter. However, Penny's mother Prudy reports Tracy to the police before tying her daughter to her bed for \"harboring a fugitive\". Having been bailed out by Wilbur, Seaweed and his friends help Tracy and Penny escape. Link visits Tracy's house after hearing about the brawl, and realizes he loves her. Seaweed and Penny also acknowledge their love during the breakout.\nWith the Miss Teenage Hairspray pageant underway, Velma assigns police officers to prevent Tracy from entering the studio, while rigging the pageant tallies to ensure Amber wins. Penny arrives at the pageant with Edna, while Wilbur, Seaweed, and the Negro Day kids sneak Tracy into the studio. As Amber is about to be declared the winner, Tracy crashes the pageant and dances for the title. Link breaks away from Amber to dance with Tracy, then brings Little Inez onstage and dances with her as well.  Little Inez wins the pageant after a late surge of voting, successfully integrating The Corny Collins Show.

Conan collected them and brought them back to his family. Conan's father, the village blacksmith, used the ore from the meteors to forge Star Metal and used it to create various tools and weapons that would never rust or break or dull. He sold them, but his finest work, a magnificent sword, he kept for Conan. It was laid in a crypt and covered over with a heavy stone slab. Conan's father told his son that only when he was \"man enough\" (i.e., strong enough) to push off the stone slab, could he rightfully claim the sword.\nMeanwhile, the evil Serpent Man wizard Wrath-Amon learned of Star Metal and that in addition to its strength that it possessed the power to open portals between dimensions. He thus sought Star Metal to release his deity Set from \"the Abyss\" to which he long ago had been banished by the combined powers of virtually every living wizard then on Earth for trying to enslave the human race. As part of his search, Wrath-Amon sought out Conan's family. Conan's father told Wrath-Amon that he had sold all of the Star Metal, but the wizard refused to believe it. The wizard was right for aside from the sword, it was revealed in a later episode that Conan's father had hidden pieces of Star Metal with other villagers. Wrath-Amon used the spell of living stone upon Conan's family.\nConan by then had gone to claim his Star Metal sword to attack Wrath-Amon and his followers. When the Star Metal sword got near Wrath-Amon, it disrupted his magic and showed his reptilian face. To this, he said \"Those who see the true face of Wrath-Amon must perish!\" (this scene is similar to one in the film). Having chased away the wizard, Conan then turned to his family and swore in the name of their god Crom to find a way of releasing them from the spell.\nConan's adventures thus begin as he searches Hyboria looking for a way to cure his family and free the land from Wrath-Amon's rule. Wrath-Amon's henchmen are also shapeshifting Serpent Men. When Conan's Star Metal sword is close enough to them, it broke the spell that disguised them and revealed their true form to be Serpent Men. When Star Metal made contact with the Serpent Men, it banishes them to the Abyss with Set. Spies and agents of Set and Stygia, many of them also Serpent Men, were present in many cities, nations and tribes throughout the land in the age of Conan.\nAs compared with the original Conan stories and the Marvel Comics such as King Conan, Conan Saga, Conan the Barbarian and Conan the King, the cartoon Conan displays a higher degree of modern morality. While the original Conan is a thief, a killer, and a philanderer, the cartoon Conan has more in common with sword-wielding children's cartoon characters such as He-Man. At one point, he refuses to join a pirate crew on the grounds that it is wrong to steal, he refuses to strike unarmed or defeated opponents. He is a kind and caring character, albeit a little naive, who stands up for his friends and what he sees to be right and is very respectable. The show also reduced the violence of the original to levels deemed suitable for the younger target audience, deliberately making the Serpent Men \"banished\" with any touch of the heroes' weapons rather than actually struck.", "title": "Conan the Adventurer (1992 TV series)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q2561069"}}

Eddy's new bride and quite his junior to the chagrin of their teenage son Jake (Zak Henri), who Hilary develops a crush on at first sight.\nThe kids make an awkward impression with each other, with Brendan calling his mom \"hot,\" and the others not knowing how to react to Espn acting like her imaginary mom is there with her as she is not ready to let go of her quite yet.\nOver time though, they begin to bond with each other and each other's parents.\nJim makes the boys happy by helping them with adventurous sports and they slowly warm up to him, ultimately seeing him as a father figure they needed, while Lauren takes care of the girls, and helps Hilary to change her tomboyish look into a more feminine one drawing the attention of her now boyfriend, Jake.\nJim is pleasantly surprised by her change of appearance and he and Lauren begin to warm up to each other as time passes.\nThey inadvertently get together for a couples massage and have fun with each other.\nAfterwards, the girls prove their affection for Lauren, when Lou asks for her to put her to bed.\nLauren does so and sings \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow,\" which, unknown to her, was the song Lou's mom used to sing.\nThe other girls pretend to sleep, while realizing how much they truly love Lauren.\nShe returns this feeling when she maternally kisses each girl's forehead as she says goodnight.\nJim starts to realize the depth of his feelings for Lauren.\nOn the last night of the trip, Lauren puts on a beautiful black dress that she admired earlier.\nShe wears it that evening and receives admiration from everyone.\nWhile the children are pulled away for a kids-only buffet, Jake briefly smiles at Ginger, earning her tearfully telling Eddy how truly happy she is, while they agree that they are ultimately going to be a beautiful family.\nMeanwhile, Jim and Lauren are sat down for a romantic dinner, which Lauren soon discovers was actually planned by Jim specifically for her.\nThey chat briefly about basic parenting techniques and then pull in for a kiss; however, at the last second, Jim pulls away, apologizing and explaining that he \"can't do it\".\nAfter returning home, Jim realizes he misses Lauren and that he's fallen in love with her, which he admits to his daughters who are ecstatic with the news.\nAlthough Espn is not fully ready to move on from her mother's passing, she also doesn't want her dad, or herself to lose Lauren.\nShe starts to move on by telling her dad that her mom said that she had other things to do in Heaven and wouldn't be around as much (and of course to increase her allowance).\nAt the kids' behest, Jim goes to Lauren's house to give her flowers, only to find her ex-husband Mark there, pretending to be back with Lauren.\nTyler gets excited to see Jim and wants to play ball, but Jim sadly leaves and Mark bails on his son again.\nMark later tries to make a move on Lauren, but she refuses since he has continuously failed to be a good father, as well as having an affair with his receptionist during their marriage.\nThat following Saturday, Lauren and Brendan go to support Tyler at his game, along with Jen, Dick, who Jen has worked things out with, and his kids.\nMark, once again, is a no-show.\nJim and his daughters arrive to show encouragement, inspiring Tyler to hit the ball.\nJim then finds Lauren and they admit to

They are coached by thirty-year veteran Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino), who has fallen out of favor with young team owner Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz) and offensive coordinator and D'Amato's expected successor Nick Crozier (Aaron Eckhart). In the thirteenth game of the season, both starting quarterback Jack \"Cap\" Rooney (Dennis Quaid) and second-string quarterback Tyler Cherubini (Pat O'Hara) are injured and forced to leave the field. The desperate Sharks call upon third-string quarterback Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx) to replace them. While a nervous Beamen makes a number of errors and fails to win the game for the Sharks, he plays well and gains confidence. Rooney vows to make it back by the playoffs, with D'Amato promising to not give up on him.\nThe next day, D'Amato and Pagniacci argue about the direction of the team. Pagniacci favors Crozier and wants to eventually cut Rooney. D'Amato argues that Pagniacci's father, the previous owner, would never meddle in his coaching plans. During the next game, to D'Amato's chagrin, Beamen disregards the team's conservative offense and changes plays in the huddle. As the media hails Beamen as the next model of quarterback, the newfound success feeds his growing narcissism and leads to tension with teammates and coaches. During a confrontation with Beamen, D'Amato demotes him back to the bench. After Beamen gives an interview taking sole credit for the Sharks' winning streak, the other players refuse to perform for Beamen and consequently lose a home game. After Beamen gets into a brawl with Julian \"J-Man\" Washington (LL Cool J), an irate D'Amato expresses his embarrassment at his team before leaving. Beamen contemplates and amends his self-centered behavior.\nAs the playoffs come around, Sharks middle linebacker Luther Lavay (Lawrence Taylor) reminds Beamen how lucky he is to be in the league and to find a life outside of football; his words fall on deaf ears. D'Amato worsens his relationship with Pagniacci and berates Rooney for second-guessing his availability. Before the game, D'Amato gives a speech urging team unity that Beamen takes to heart. Rooney returns as starting quarterback, but is injured with a concussion after scoring a touchdown. Rooney urges D'Amato to let Beamen finish the game, which after an argument he allows, while Pagniacci enters the locker room to demand that Beamen play which, after D'Amato and her argue, Beamen informs her that he had already been told he would start the second half. Beamen apologizes to his teammates for his actions and leads the team to win. He dedicates the next game to Rooney.\nThe Sharks eventually lost the championship final known as Pantheon Cup to San Francisco. At D'Amato's final press conference as head coach, he is thanked by Pagniacci. D'Amato is expected to announce his retirement, but he instead drops two bombshells and announces that he has been hired as head coach and general manager of an expansion team in New Mexico, the Albuquerque Aztecs, and that he has signed Willie Beamen to be his starting quarterback and franchise player.", "title": "Any Given Sunday", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q482662"}}

After rejecting several possible men who are about to die, Joe is persuaded to accept the body of a millionaire industrialist. Leo Farnsworth has just been drugged and drowned in his bathtub by his cheating wife Julia Farnsworth and her lover Tony Abbott, Farnsworth's personal secretary.\nJulia and Tony are confused when Leo reappears alive and well. Farnsworth's domestic staff are confused by the changes in some of his habits and tastes. Still obsessed with his football destiny, Farnsworth/Joe buys the Rams to lead them to the Super Bowl as their quarterback. To succeed, he must first convince, and then secure the help of longtime friend and trainer Max Corkle to get his new body in shape. At the same time, he falls in love with Betty Logan, an environmental activist, whom he met when she came to his doorstep to protest the original Farnsworth's corporate policies.\nWith the Rams about to play in the Super Bowl, all the characters face a crisis. Mr. Jordan informs Joe that he must give up Farnsworth's body as well. Joe resists, but hints to Betty that she might someday meet someone else and should think of him. Julia and Abbott continue their murderous plans, and Abbott shoots Farnsworth/Joe dead. The Rams are forced to start Tom Jarrett, another quarterback in the climactic game. A detective, Lieutenant Krim, interrogates the suspects while they watch the game on television. With the help of Corkle, he gets Julia and Abbott to incriminate each other.\nAfter a brutal hit on the field, Jarrett is killed. With Mr. Jordan's help, Joe then occupies his final body. He is shown snapping to life in Jarrett's body, then leading the Rams to victory. During the team's post-game celebration, Corkle finds Joe, and when he realizes that it is him, they share an emotional embrace.\nAs Joe is being interviewed on television, Mr. Jordan tells him that, to live as Tom Jarrett, he will have to lose the memories of his life as Joe Pendleton. As Mr. Jordan disappears, Tom/Joe becomes disoriented. Corkle goes to find Joe later, and is crestfallen to realize that Joe has \"left\" Tom. \nJarrett bumps into Betty while leaving the stadium. They strike up a conversation, and each appears to recognize the other but they don't know how. The lights go out in the stadium as they exit the venue, and Tom says something that reminds Betty of Farnsworth/Joe. This echoes earlier in the film when Joe had asked Betty to watch for and recognize something/someone in a stranger she might meet one day. Tom asks her to go with him for coffee and she accepts.", "title": "Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q637180"}}

Marnie cannot go to a friend's costume party, and her mother offers no clear explanation. Gwen's mother Agatha, or \"Aggie\" (Debbie Reynolds) shows up for her annual Halloween visit. The children are happier to see Aggie than Gwen is, as Aggie openly encourages the children to get more involved in Halloween. Aggie and Gwen are secretly witches, but Gwen is determined to live a normal life as a mortal instead.\nDespite objections from Gwen, Aggie is intent on training Marnie as a witch. Before heading home, Aggie reads the children a bedtime story called \"Halloweentown,\" about a mystical place where witches, vampires and monsters of all sorts live in peace. Sophie points out a drawing of a witch in the book that resembles Marnie; Aggie does nothing to stop Marnie from imagining such a thing. After putting the children to bed, Gwen and Aggie get into an argument, with Marnie, who has sneaked downstairs, eavesdropping. Gwen is angry that her mother encourages the children to enjoy Halloween, and insists Marnie will be raised as a mortal, like her father was, and not a witch. Aggie doesn't understand why Gwen wants to live without magic, and wants to train Marnie before she turns 13, as at this point without training, she would lose her powers. Aggie then asks Gwen for help. Citizens of Halloweentown have been disappearing, and while Gwen doesn't take this seriously and says it is possible that the missing have simply moved, Aggie believes that foul play is involved.\nWhen Aggie leaves to return home, Marnie and Dylan covertly follow her. They see Aggie getting onto a magical bus, and sneak onto it through the back door. When they arrive in Halloweentown, Aggie does not see Marnie and Dylan getting off the bus, and the children lose sight of her. At the same time, Marnie and Dylan realize that Sophie has sneaked onto the bus with them. They begin looking for Aggie, and are approached by Kalabar (Robin Thomas), the mayor of Halloweentown. He whistles for a cab driven by Benny (voiced by Rino Romano), a skeleton with a bad sense of humor. The children find their grandmother's mansion, and against her better judgment, Aggie decides not to take them back to their home immediately. She says she will start Marnie's witch training, but has to take care of \"the bad thing\" first. She shows her grandchildren what she is talking about: in her cauldron, a vision of a hooded figure appears, laughing maniacally. She says she must activate Merlin's talisman with a spell and potion to defeat the evil creature.\nAfter trying, and failing, to light the talisman with \"instant\" potion, Aggie takes the children back to town to shop for the right ingredients. The family is introduced to Luke (Phillip Van Dyke), a goblin who was made handsome by a shadow demon. He makes a clumsy pass at Marnie which she turns down on the spot. Gwen, who had noticed her children were missing and immediately blamed Aggie, arrives in Halloweentown to retrieve them, much to Marnie's objections. Gwen tells the children to say goodbye to Aggie, then takes them to the bus station, but cannot find another bus back to the mortal world according to a two-headed ticket vendor and decides to see if the mayor can do anything to help. She is shocked to see that the mayor is Kalabar, an ex-boyfriend of hers. After Kalabar briefly leaves to handle another problem, Gwen and her children see Aggie walking somewhere with Luke. Sensing Aggie might be in trouble, they follow Luke and her to an abandoned movie theater.\nAggie meets the hooded demon in the theater, where the missing Halloweentown citizens have been frozen in time. Aggie declines to give the talisman to the demon. Gwen and the children enter the theater as Luke rushes out in fear. The demon freezes Gwen and Aggie. The children escape, and obtain the necessary ingredients\u2013the hair of a werewolf, the sweat of a ghost, and a vampire's fang\u2013to make the potion that will activate the talisman. They then realize they must place the talisman in the large jack-o'-lantern in the center of the town to defeat the demon.\nWhen they arrive to install it, the demon suddenly appears and reveals himself to be Kalabar, who is bitter that Gwen (whom he used to date when she was a teenager) chose to marry a human instead of him. He starts talking to the townspeople and tries to persuade them to join him and take over the mortal world. With the help of Luke, Marnie slips past Kalabar long enough to climb up onto the jack-o'-lantern and try to place the talisman inside. Kalabar, noticing this, casts a spell to freeze her. As she is about to pass out, Marnie drops the talisman inside the jack-o'-lantern, which causes it to illuminate. This unfreezes her and everyone trapped inside the theater, and severely weakens Kalabar. Kalabar obtains the talisman and says he will use it to become the ruler of both the mortal and magical world. Dylan is revealed to have magic powers and eventually joins Gwen, Aggie, and his sisters in confronting Kalabar and using their combined powers to defeat him. Luke is restored to his goblin appearance.\nThe film ends with the family getting on the bus and blasting off to the mortal world.

Soon thereafter,  an investigation is set in motion by the Central Intelligence Agency. Flight 66 lands at the U.S. air base in Iceland, but one passenger is so distraught at being separated from her child and at being in quarantine that she runs down the airplane stairs and is shot and killed by U.S. troops in MOPP gear.  Holland flies the aircraft toward Mauritania, but a female intelligence agent warns Holland that an assassin is trying to destroy the flight.  Holland tricks the assassin (in a missile-armed Learjet 35) into crashing and lands on Ascension Island.\nThe book mentions that the virus becomes less lethal and enters the human population.

From his bedroom window, he sees a large flying saucer descend and disappear into the sandpit area behind his home. After rushing to tell his parents, his scientist father (Leif Erickson) goes to investigate David's claim. When his father returns much later in the morning, David notices an unusual red puncture along the hairline on the back of his father's neck; his father is now behaving in a cold and hostile manner. David soon begins to realize something is very wrong: he notices certain townsfolk are acting in exactly the same way. Through his telescope, David sees child neighbor Kathy Wilson suddenly disappear underground while walking in the sandpit. David flees to the police station for help and is eventually placed under the protection of health-department physician Dr. Pat Blake (Helena Carter), who slowly begins to believe his crazy story.\n\nWith the help of local astronomer Dr. Stuart Kelston (Arthur Franz) and Dr. Blake, David soon realizes the flying saucer is likely the vanguard of an invasion from the planet Mars, now in close orbital proximity to Earth. Dr. Kelston contacts the U.S. Army and convinces them to immediately investigate: An important government rocket research plant is located nearby. In short order, the Pentagon assembles troops and tanks under the command of Colonel Fielding (Morris Ankrum). An alien sabotage plot at the plant is soon uncovered, leading back to the sandpit, and the army surrounds the saucer landing site.\nStanding well away from the army search, Dr. Blake and young David are suddenly sucked underground. They are captured by two tall, slit-eyed green humanoids and taken via tunnels to the flying saucer. Army troops locate and blow open an entrance to the tunnels, and Colonel Fielding and a small detachment make their way to the saucer entrance. Inside, they confront the Martian mastermind: It has a giant green head with a humanoid face atop a small, green partial torso with several green arm-tentacles, and is encased in a transparent sphere. The Martian is served by the tall, green, silent, synthetic mutants. Under their master's mental commands, the mute humanoids have implanted mind-control crystals at the base of the skull of their kidnapped victims, forcing them to attempt sabotage at an atomic rocket project being built at a military plant near the town; if they are caught, the mind control devices explode, causing a fatal cerebral hemorrhage. The troops and Colonel Fielding, with Dr. Blake and David in tow, open fire on the pursuing mutants as their group escapes the saucer. After a short running battle in the tunnels, they return to the surface. Orders are given for everyone to quickly leave the area: Fielding's troops have planted timed explosive charges aboard the saucer. David runs downhill away from the sandpit, and artillery opens fire on the sandpit, as the charges ticking timer slowly approaches zero.\nFollowing the large explosion, David is suddenly back in his bed during a thunder and lightning storm. He runs into his parents' bedroom, confused and frightened; they reassure him that he was just having a bad dream, telling him to go back to sleep. Having returned to his bed, more wind and loud thunder is heard. David climbs out of bed again, goes to his window, and witnesses the very same flying saucer in his nightmare slowly descending into the sandpit, to which he responds, \"Gee whiz\"!", "title": "Invaders from Mars (1953 film)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q1671695"}}

{"id": "tt0751202", "text": "FBI agents Dana Scully and Fox Mulder travel to Browning, Montana to investigate the killing of a Native American man, Joseph Goodensnake, by local rancher Jim Parker. The killing appears to be motivated by a dispute over the ownership of a tract of land, although Parker claims that he fired on a monstrous animal rather than a human. Parker's son, Lyle, bears scars that lend credence to the story.\nAt the scene of the shooting, Scully reasons that at the short range from which Goodensnake was shot, it would have been impossible to mistake him for an animal. However, Mulder finds tracks leading to the area that appear to change from human to something more animal in nature. Scully dismisses this, but finds a large section of shed human skin nearby. She believes that the Parkers knowingly killed Goodensnake, but knows that they could not have skinned him since no signs of such injury were found on the body.\nThe investigation is complicated by the hostility Mulder and Scully face from the Native American population, stemming from their experience with the FBI during the 1973 Wounded Knee incident. Goodensnake's sister Gwen is also bitter that her neighbors are too frightened of native legends to confront his death. The local sheriff, Charles Tskany, permits Scully to make a cursory examination of Goodensnake's body but forbids a full autopsy. They discover that he had elongated canines, similar to those of an animal, and bears long-healed scars similar to Lyle's.\nMulder tells Scully of a similar incident in the area forty years previously, which was investigated by J. Edgar Hoover and became the FBI's first X-File case. As the agents watch Goodensnake's body being cremated in a traditional ceremony, Mulder shares with Scully his belief that the culprits in both the current case and Hoover's investigation are werewolves. Scully dismisses this theory and instead credits the belief to clinical lycanthropy. Jim Parker is subsequently ripped apart by an unseen animal outside his home, and Lyle is found naked and unconscious a few hundred yards away.\nIsh, one of the elder men of the reservation, explains to Mulder the legend of the manitou, a creature which can possess and transform a man and can pass to a new host, through a bite, or upon the death of the original host. Ish believes he had seen the creature in his youth, but was too frightened to confront it. He says it happens every eight years to someone in the region, and that it has been that long since the last sighting of a possible manitou. \nMulder calls the medical examiner, who tells him that Scully has taken Lyle back to the ranch, and Jim's blood type was found in Lyle's stomach. Mulder and Tskany hurry to the Parker ranch. After firing on the creature, which escapes unharmed, Mulder finds Scully hiding upstairs. They search for the creature, which is shot by Tskany as it lunges to attack them. Scully expresses disbelief on seeing Lyle\u2019s body, believing they were attacked by a captive mountain lion; Tskany replies that the lion is still in its cage.

After returning to his house he finds his pet dead and is attacked by the other dog, a wolflike creature with glowing red eyes.\nMulder and Scully arrive at the port and talk to the man who imported the dog, Dr. Ian Detweiler (Andrew Robinson), a cryptozoologist. Detweiler says the dog is a Wanshang dhole, a species thought to be extinct. The two agents soon receive news of the other attack and, after investigating, Mulder believes the dhole has near-human intelligence. Mulder and Scully visit Berquist, who tells them that the species they are looking for is extinct. Meanwhile, a dog catcher is chasing a stray through a warehouse when a man enters the building. He promptly transforms into the murderous dhole and attacks the dog catcher. Mulder and Scully arrive at the scene, followed by Berquist, who finds a paw print with five toes.\nLater that night, Detweiler arrives at a vet's office to get tranquilizers. The vet goes to the office's kennel area and is attacked by the dhole, but is able to escape and lock the kennel door behind him. The dog catchers arrive and open fire, but the fallen animal turns out to be a Saint Bernard brought there by its owner. While the vet tries to operate on the hurt Saint Bernard, Scully arrives and hears screams coming from the kennels, where she discovers that the vet has been attacked. After Scully leaves, the wounded Saint Bernard on the operating table transforms into the dhole, revealing that it can mimic any shape.\nScully begins to question Berquist's motives, noting that she was the reason Mulder decided to look into this investigation. Mulder, however, begins to suspect Detweiler after learning that he had been at the vet's office; Mulder believes that he is the dhole and is tranquilizing himself in an attempt to stop killing. Mulder asks Cahn to confront Detweiler, but Cahn is attacked and severely injured by the dhole and placed in the hospital. Mulder visits Berquist and says he thinks she has not been honest with him. Berquist reveals that she first suspected Detweiler when she saw him. She also says that he will try to finish off Cahn. Mulder worriedly tells Scully, who remains skeptical.\nLater, Berquist hears something in the woods while locking one of the outside kennels at her home. She goes upstairs to retrieve a tranquilizer gun, but when Detweiler, in the guise of the dhole, enters her bedroom to attack her, she sets the gun aside and challenges the dhole. He attacks, causing both of them to fall out of the window behind her. Mulder and Scully arrive and find Detweiler's and Berquist's bodies, the former impaled on a fence spike.

the metallic ball seen earlier, along with its schematics and a letter instructing him to guard it.\nThen, Alfred and Jason, two members of a company called \"The O'Hara Foundation\" arrive and attempt to steal the sphere, but Lloyd appears just in time to distract them, allowing Ray to escape with the package.\nWith Emma's help, he manages to activate his monowheel as more agents, operating a large steam automotive, give chase, succeeding in thwarting it on a railway line by putting it in the way of an incoming train.\nBy coincidence, Robert Stephenson, who was the intended recipient of the Steam Ball, was on his way to Manchester to meet with the elder dr Steam, and happens to be on the train.\nHowever, as the train approaches the station, a zeppelin carrying Alfred descends over their compartment and kidnaps Ray, taking the ball with them.\nArriving in London sometime prior to the 1866 Great Exhibition, during a dining session Ray meets Scarlett O'Hara, the spoiled granddaughter of the Foundation's head chairman;

his grandfather Lloyd introducing Ray to electricity and finally passing away; the Great War being fought with paratroopers and zeppelins; his father Eddie founding a corporate conglomerate; and Scarlett maturing and becoming a famous pilot.", "title": "Steamboy", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q1315185"}}

Silus's brother Edgar (Leo Gregory).\nEdgar has sent Silus a recording of his last murder, challenging him to find and stop him before he kills again.\nEdgar provides the location of his next murder.\nWith Silus' help, Lilly puts together a task force to stake out the area Edgar has targeted.\nHowever Edgar distracts the cops and attacks Lilly, biting her in the neck.\nAn officer interrupts the attack and Edgar flees.\nTo save Lilly's life, Silus tells her to drink his blood, which she does.\nSilus then pursues Edgar, managing to shoot him with a tranquilizing dart.\nSilus later visits Lilly in hospital.\nWe establish that she has no family as they died from influenza.\nLilly is having visions from drinking Silus' blood.\nThe newspapers have published a fake story of the death of the killer;

There is a news report on TV about unexplained mass suicides in Romania, quickly spreading across Europe. At a routine checkup at the hospital, Malorie sees a woman bashing her head into a window, then others panicking as chaos erupts. Jessica sees the entity, deliberately drives her car erratically, overturns it, and then she kills herself by walking in front of an oncoming truck.\nAs Malorie flees on foot, a woman invites her into a house for safety, even though her husband strongly protests. The woman sees the entity, goes into a trance, talks to her dead mother, and then sits inside a burning car, which quickly explodes. A passerby, Tom, picks up Malorie from the street, and they are let into the house, where about a dozen other people are taking shelter. One is a man employed by a grocery store, who theorizes that demonic entities have invaded Earth, driving people insane. The refugees in the house cover all the windows, and blindfold themselves whenever they go out. The house's owner offers to monitor the surveillance cameras to watch the entities indirectly, but he kills himself by violently smashing his own skull.\nAs the food supply diminishes (and with the arrival of a new pregnant survivor, Olympia), half of the group go to a nearby supermarket. Malorie gets some pet birds along with their supplies. They hear Charlie's co-worker, who is locked outside the supermarket begging for help, and Charlie describes him as \"a little crazy.\" The presence of the entities causes the birds to go into hysterics. The group is attacked by the co-worker, who is being used by the entities to infect others. Charlie sacrifices himself to save the others, who make it back to the house.\nSometime after, Felix and Lucy steal the car and drive away. Olympia lets Gary, a stranger, into the house, against Douglas' wishes. Threatening Gary with a shotgun, Douglas is knocked out and locked in the garage. As Olympia and Malorie go into labour simultaneously, Gary works on various drawings of the entities in a trance-like state. After putting the birds in the freezer, he starts uncovering the windows. He opens the garage door to expose Douglas to the entities, knocks out Tom with a can of food, and goes upstairs.

Forced to look, Cheryl stabs herself in the neck with a pair of scissors. Douglas blindly attempts to kill Gary with a shotgun but fails, so Gary kills Douglas with scissors.

The gang is ambushed by Pike's former partner, Deke Thornton, who is leading a posse of bounty hunters hired and deputized by the railroad. A bloody shootout kills more than half of the gang. Pike uses a serendipitous temperance union parade to shield their getaway, and many citizens are killed in the crossfire.\nPike rides off with Dutch Engstrom, brothers Lyle and Tector Gorch, and Angel, the only survivors. They are dismayed when the loot from the robbery turns out to be a decoy: steel washers instead of silver coin. The men reunite with old-timer Freddie Sykes and head for Mexico.\nPike's men cross the Rio Grande and take refuge that night in the village where Angel was born. The townsfolk are ruled by General Mapache, a corrupt, brutal officer in the Mexican Federal Army, who has been ravaging the area's villages to feed his troops, who have been losing to the forces of the revolutionary Pancho Villa. Pike's gang makes contact with the general. \nA jealous Angel spots Teresa, his former lover, in Mapache's arms and shoots her dead, angering Mapache. Pike defuses the situation and offers to work for Mapache. \nMapache tasks the gang to steal a weapons shipment from a U.S. Army train so that Mapache can resupply his troops and appease Commander Mohr, his German military adviser, who wishes to obtain samples of America's armaments. The reward will be a cache of gold coins.\nAngel gives up his share of the gold to Pike in return for sending one crate of rifles and ammunition to a band of rebels opposed to Mapache. The holdup goes largely as planned until Thornton's posse turns up on the train the gang has robbed.

The pursuers temporarily regroup at a riverside camp and then quickly take off again after the Bunch.\n\nPike and his men, knowing they risk being double-crossed by Mapache, devise a way of bringing him the stolen weapons without his double-crossing them. However, Mapache learns from Teresa's mother that Angel stole a crate of guns and ammo, and reveals this as Angel and Engstrom deliver the last of the weapons. Surrounded by Mapache's army, Angel desperately tries to escape, only to be captured and tortured. Mapache lets Engstrom go, and Engstrom rejoins Pike's gang and tells them what happened.\nSykes is wounded by Thornton's posse while securing spare horses. The rest of Pike's gang returns to Agua Verde for shelter, where a drunken celebration celebrating the weapons transfer has commenced. They see Angel being dragged on the ground by a rope tied behind the general's car, and after a brief frolic with prostitutes and a period of reflection, Pike and the gang try to forcibly persuade Mapache to release Angel, who by then is barely alive after the torture. \nThe general appears to comply; however, as the gang watches, he instead cuts Angel's throat. Pike and Engstrom angrily gun Mapache down in front of his men. \nFor a moment, the federales are so shocked that they fail to return fire, causing Engstrom to laugh in surprise.

Bronagh disappears late one night, presumably dying after her delightful \"childbirth\", leaving behind a mute daughter named Saoirse.\nSix years later, Conor is broken, Saoirse is still mute, and Ben is hostile toward Saoirse, blaming her for Bronagh's disappearance. On Saoirse's birthday, they are visited by their grandmother, \"Granny,\" who regards the lighthouse as an unfit place to raise the children. That night, Ben scares Saoirse with a story of Mac Lir and his mother Macha, the Owl Witch, who stole his feelings and turned him to stone. Later, Saoirse plays a seashell horn given to Ben by their mother, leading her to a white sealskin coat in Conor's closet. She puts on the coat and walks to a group of seals in the sea, revealing herself as a selkie. After swimming, she is found by Granny on the seashore, who insists upon taking the children to the city. Conor reluctantly agrees despite Ben's protests and locks the coat in a chest, then throwing it into the sea.\nOn Halloween, Saoirse plays Ben's seashell, alerting the F\u00e6ries called \"Na Daoine S\u00eddhe\" to her. She and Ben attempt to go home, but encounter the F\u00e6ries, who hope she will allow them to return to the T\u00edr na n\u00d3g.

However, Saoirse is growing ill, due to not having her seal coat and being away from the ocean. They come across a holy well into which Saoirse dives into. Ben follows her and meets the Great Seanacha\u00ed: they learn Saoirse was kidnapped by Macha, and she is mute because she needs the coat and will soon die if she does not get it back. He gives Ben one of his hairs that will lead him to Macha. As he follows the hair, it shows him that Bronagh \u2013 a selkie herself \u2013 was forced to return to the ocean on the night of Saoirse's birth, leaving her husband and the child behind. Since Ben found the truth, the walls of hair open, showing him a way out and to the house. The F\u00e6ries who turned to stone speak out to warn Ben to avoid the jars, tell him to be careful and brave, and wish him good luck.\nBen then meets Macha, who explains that when Mac Lir suffered from a broken heart, she turned him into an island near their home. She is determined to do likewise for everyone, even herself, believing it will spare everyone of the pain. Ben manages to rescue Saoirse, giving Macha back her feelings and allowing her to recognize that taking away feelings doesn't help. She helps to fly them back home along with two F\u00e6rie dogs, and Conor attempts to take Saoirse to a hospital; simultaneously, Granny is nearing the island to find them. Ben dives into the sea in search of Saoirse's coat and recovers it with the seals\u2019 help. After Conor brings him on the boat, Saoirse's coat is put on her, and her voice surprises Ben and Conor. Saoirse's coat changes her into a little seal. Ben rides on her back and his father rides on another seal's back to Mac Lir's island. The group is then washed up on Mac Lir's island, but Saoirse's health is not fully restored. Ben tries to get Saoirse to sing, and she eventually sings the Song of the Sea. The song causes Saoirse's health to be fully restored, making the magical golden lights which cause the spirits and the F\u00e6ries to rise out of the stone and travel to Mac Lir, along with Macha. Mac Lir is transformed back into his original form out of the stone and continues with Macha, his dogs, the Great Seanacha\u00ed and the Faeries back home to T\u00edr na n\u00d3g.\nBronagh appears to take Saoirse to T\u00edr na n\u00d3g with her, but Ben and Conor plead to let Saoirse stay with them, because she's all they have. Since she is half-human, the choice rests with Saoirse, who elects to remain behind with her father and brother, even though it means giving up her selkie powers and becoming fully human, if Bronagh takes Saoirse's coat to untangle their worlds. Accepting her daughter's decision, Bronagh takes her coat. Conor tells Bronagh that he loves her so much, and they kiss. Ben asks Bronagh to stay as well, but she is unable to and tells him to remember her in his stories and songs and that she'll always love him, before kissing her son's forehead. After a tearful farewell, Ben and his family happily return home to their island, where Granny finally arrives, and Conor tells her he's now well enough to take care of the children. \nIn a mid-credits scene, the family is shown happily painting a mural of their home, Bronough, and the Faeries, and celebrating Ben's birthday, and Ben and Saoirse, now closer than ever, go swimming with C\u00fa and the seals in the ocean.", "title": "Song of the Sea (2014 film)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q17125101"}}

{"id": "tt0751095", "text": "At a video arcade in Connerville, Oklahoma, two young men, Jack Hammond and Darin Peter Oswald, argue over a game of Virtua Fighter 2. Hammond pushes Oswald to the ground, after which the power in the arcade mysteriously shuts down\u2014except to a jukebox, which plays \"Ring the Bells\" by James. This causes Hammond to leave, but when he goes outside to start his car, he finds the same song playing on the radio. He is then fatally electrocuted through the ignition. Oswald, who witnesses Hammond's death, returns to the game.\nHammond is the latest of five local men who have died due to lightning-related causes, causing Fox Mulder and Dana Scully to investigate. Scully talks to Bart \"Zero\" Liquori, the arcade owner and Oswald's friend, who was present the night Hammond died. Mulder finds Oswald's high scores on the game's display, realizing that he was playing that night; Oswald was the first of the victims, and the only one to have survived. Elsewhere, Oswald is at work at an auto repair shop when his boss's wife, Sharon Kiveat, walks in. He then tries talking to her, but she nervously rebuffs him; it is revealed that he had hit on her the day before, and she turned him down. When the agents arrive and question Oswald, he claims to have not witnessed anything. However, Mulder's cell phone mysteriously overheats in Oswald's presence, to which he acts unsurprised.\nAlarmed by the FBI's presence, Zero visits Oswald at his home that night; a drunk and rowdy Oswald dismisses Zero's worries and summons lightning to strike down nearby cattle. The lightning strikes him instead, but he appears unharmed. The next day, the agents visit the scene and find a melted shoe print in the ground, linking it to Oswald. Meanwhile, Oswald uses his abilities to manipulate local traffic lights, causing a car accident. The agents visit Oswald's home and find a cut-out picture of Kiveat, Oswald's former high school teacher, inside a porn magazine.\nAt the scene of the car accident, Oswald's boss suffers an oddly timed heart attack; Oswald then saves him by using his electrical powers as a makeshift defibrillator, much to the paramedics' surprise. The agents question Sharon at the hospital, who claims that he told her about his powers. The agents also go through Oswald's medical records, showing that he exhibited acute hypokalemia\u2014electrolytic imbalance in his blood. Oswald is brought in for questioning by the agents, but he proclaims his innocence and is eventually released by the local sheriff. Later, Oswald, believing that Zero ratted him out to the agents, uses his powers to strike him dead with lightning.\nAfter learning of Oswald's release, the agents rush to the hospital to protect the Kiveats, but the power goes out when they arrive and Zero's corpse appears in the elevator when its door slides open. Oswald confronts Scully and Sharon, and the latter fearfully agrees to leave with him in return for her husband's safety. The sheriff arrives and tries to stop him. While pursuing a fleeing Sharon, Oswald summons lightning but ends up striking himself once again and, in the process, kills the sheriff. Oswald is put in a psychiatric hospital, although the local district attorney has no idea how they will be able to prosecute him. As the agents observe Oswald, he uses his powers to change the channels of the TV in his room while the song \"Live Fast, Diarrhea\" by The Vandals is heard.", "title": "D.P.O.

{"id": "tt0113682", "text": "Opening on a pub near Loch Ness, a scientist named dr Abernathy steps out for some air.\nStanding on the shore of the loch, he sees something rise from the water.\nAstonished, he takes a single photograph before slipping and falling on the rocks, which kills him.\nA short time later in Los Angeles, disgruntled freshman college tutor, dr John Dempsey (Ted Danson), is obligated to journey to Scotland to replace dr Abernathy, who was searching for the Loch Ness Monster.\nDempsey is reluctant to do so, as he ruined his respected zoology career after a fruitless three year search for the Sasquatch and is now considered a joke amongst his colleagues.\nThe only reason he agrees to go is because he is broke and cannot pay alimony to his former wife, Caroline, after whom he named a newly discovered species of wasp.\nDempsey travels to Scotland and reluctantly begins on a cryptozoology mission along with Adrian Foote (James Frain), former assistant to dr Abernathy and an eager young Scottish man who fanatically believes in the existence of the creature.\nDempsey repeatedly claims there is no mystery and that the monster is just a hoax created by the locals of Loch Ness to support their economy.\nJohn books into a small inn and meets his grouchy landlady, Laura McFetridge (Joely Richardson) and her nine-year-old daughter, Isabel, who quickly grows close to John.\nJohn quickly finds himself in hot water with the locals, in particular one named Andy McLean (Nick Brimble), who sees Dempsey as a rival for the affections of Laura.\nThe water bailiff, (Ian Holm), guardian and protector of Loch Ness, does all he can to ensure that Dempsey fails in his search and leaves the loch empty-handed.\nAfter the sonar equipment is sabotaged by the locals, Dempsey confronts the water bailiff, who insists that the mystery of Loch Ness will never be destroyed.\nDempsey challenges him to \"come out and watch him\".\nAfter scanning the entire loch and finding nothing, Dempsey declares it is the end of the Loch Ness monster, leaving Adrian crushed, but the subsequent argument between them ends on a slightly reconciliatory note when Dempsey tells Adrian that, despite his scepticism, he did want to find the monster.\nThroughout the film, Laura overcomes her initial dislike of Dempsey and they quickly grow attracted to each other.\nIsabel possesses a second sight and is able to foretell certain things, such as her mother's growing affection for Dempsey.\nThe day before Dempsey's departure from Loch Ness, Adrian brings him the remainder of dr Abernathy's possessions, including his camera.\nThe next morning Adrian is awakened by Dempsey, who says they are going back out for another sweep of the loch.\nHe reveals that after developing the pictures on Abernathy's camera, the last picture on the roll shows a large, rhomboid shaped flipper submerging into the water.\nAfter tracking a 40&nbsp;ft object chasing a school of salmon, it collides with the boat, sinking it and sending Dempsey and Adrian into the water.\nDempsey nearly drowns but somehow surfaces after a large dark object is seen moving in the water behind his quickly sinking body.\nAfter returning to the inn, he is ecstatic, claiming to have seen the creature while under the water.\nAfter Dempsey is beaten up by Andy McLean for \"moving in on his woman\", Isabel makes him a get well card which features a drawing of what she calls a \"water kelpie\".\nDempsey realises that Isabel, too, has seen the monster, as her drawing of the creature's fins are identical to the picture taken by Abernathy.\nAfter Dempsey promises to buy her the red bicycle that she has always wanted, Isabel agrees to show him the monster.\nLater that day, Isabel leads Dempsey to an underground cavern beneath Urquhart Castle and warns him not to use lights as it scares the creatures.\nAfter a startling encounter with some sea otters, Dempsey prepares to leave, humiliated.\nSuddenly a plesiosaur rises from the water and Isabel is shown to know it very well, even being able to communicate with it through a series of whistle-like calls.\nResponding to the calls, a second creature appears, the two animals apparently being mates.\nWhile in an astonished euphoria, Dempsey ignores Isabel's warnings and takes a photograph, the flash alarming the creatures, causing them to dive back into the water and cause havoc.\nIsabel falls into the water and almost drowns and Dempsey is saved by the furious Water Bailiff.\nDempsey develops the photographs and faces Laura's wrath about him using Isabel and nearly getting her killed.\nLaura refuses to have anything to do with Dempsey or his discovery of the monster, despite his claims that when he reveals the existence of the creatures, Laura's business will boom as people from all over the world come to the loch to see the monsters.\nLaura evicts John and Isabel is deeply hurt that Dempsey used her in such a way.\nUpset, but not about to give up his chance at vindication, he leaves for London to attend a press conference at the Natural History Museum where he plans to reveal the photos of the monsters to the world.\nThe water bailiff follows him on the train, imploring him not to reveal the truth of Loch Ness.\nDempsey insists that exposure will be best for the creatures, claiming that science will be able to care for the creatures professionally.\nScornful, the water bailiff points out the irony in that it was not science that helped his \"discovery\", but a little girl.\nHe also reminds Dempsey of the harm done to the planet because of science and that these creatures have survived unaided since before the ice age.\nAt the conference, Dempsey is unable to go through with it and replaces the real photos with Isabel's drawing of the \"kelpie\", causing an uproar while he discreetly leaves.\nOn the way out, he tells a baffled Adrian that he had the pictures made by computer before he ever came to Scotland.\nAdrian, knowing the truth, understandingly plays along.\nMeanwhile, on a bus headed back to Loch Ness, the water bailiff discovers the pictures inside his suitcase and is moved almost to the point of tears.\nDempsey returns to the inn and reunites with Laura, along with the red bicycle he promised Isabel.\nIn Loch Ness, the plesiosaur pair is seen swimming underwater with a baby alongside.", "title": "Loch Ness (film)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q3257706"}}

{"id": "tt5311514", "text": "Mitsuha Miyamizu is a high school girl living in the rural town of Itomori near Hida. Bored of the town, she wishes to be a Tokyo boy in her next life. She inexplicably begins to switch bodies intermittently with Taki Tachibana, a high school boy in Tokyo, waking up as the other person and having to live through their activities and social interactions for the day. The two initially believe these experiences to be vivid dreams, but eventually realize they can communicate with each other by leaving messages on paper, phones and sometimes on each other's skin. Mitsuha (in Taki's body) sets Taki up on a date with his coworker Miki Okudera, while Taki (in Mitsuha's body) causes Mitsuha to become popular at school. One day, Taki (in Mitsuha's body) accompanies Mitsuha's grandmother Hitoha and her sister Yotsuha to leave the ritual alcohol kuchikamizake, made by the sisters, as an offering at the Shinto shrine located on a mountaintop outside the town. It is believed to represent the body of the village guardian god ruling over human connections and time. Taki reads a note from Mitsuha about the comet Tiamat, expected to pass nearest to Earth on the day of the autumn festival. The next day, Taki wakes up in his body and goes on a date with Miki, who tells him she enjoyed the date but also that she can tell that he is preoccupied with thoughts of someone else. Taki attempts to call Mitsuha on the phone, but cannot reach her and finds the body-switching has ended.\nTaki, Miki, and their friend Tsukasa travel to Gifu by train on a trip to Hida, though Taki does not know the name of the town, instead relying on sketches he has made of the surrounding landscape from memory. A restaurant owner in Hida recognizes the town in the sketch as Itomori, being originally from there. He takes Taki and his friends to the ruins of the town, which has been destroyed and where five hundred residents were killed when the comet Tiamat unexpectedly fragmented three years earlier. While gazing over the impact crater in disbelief, Taki observes Mitsuha's messages disappear from his phone and his memories of her begin to gradually fade. Taki finds Mitsuha's name in the record of fatalities, and he wonders if the body-switching was just a dream. While Miki and Tsukasa return to Tokyo, Taki journeys to the shrine, hoping to reconnect with Mitsuha and warn her about the comet. In the shrine, Taki drinks Mitsuha's kuchikamizake then lapses into a vision, where he glimpses Mitsuha's past. He also recalls that he had already encountered Mitsuha on a train three years earlier when she came to Tokyo in her own timeframe to find him, though Taki did not recognize her as the body-switching was yet to occur in his timeframe. Before leaving the train in embarrassment, Mitsuha had handed him her hair ribbon, which he has since worn on his wrist as a good-luck charm.\nTaki wakes up in Mitsuha's body at her house on the morning of the festival. Hitoha deduces what has happened and tells him the body-switching ability has passed down in her family as caretakers of the shrine. Taki convinces Tessie and Sayaka, two of Mitsuha's friends, to get the townspeople to evacuate Itomori, by disabling the electrical substation and broadcasting a false emergency alert. Taki heads to the shrine, realizing that Mitsuha must be in his body there, while Mitsuha wakes up in Taki's body. At the mountaintop during sunset, the two sense each other's presence, but are separated due to contrasting timeframes and cannot see each other. When twilight falls (referred to in the film as \"magic hour\" or kataware-doki), they return to their own bodies and see each other in person. After Taki returns Mitsuha's ribbon, they attempt to write their names on each other's palm so that they will remember each other. Before Mitsuha can write hers, however, twilight passes and they revert to their respective timeframes. When the evacuation plan fails, Mitsuha has to convince her father Toshiki, the mayor of Itomori, to evacuate everyone. Before doing so, Mitsuha notices her memories of Taki are fading away and discovers he wrote \"I love you\" on her hand instead of his own name. The comet's fragments crash to Earth and destroy Itomori. Taki wakes up in his own timeframe remembering nothing.\nFive years later, Taki has graduated from university and searches for a job. He senses that he lost something important that he cannot identify, and feels inexplicable interest in the events surrounding the comet, now eight years past. The town of Itomori had been destroyed; however, all of its people survived as they had evacuated just in time. Meanwhile, Mitsuha has since moved to Tokyo. Some time later, Taki and Mitsuha glimpse each other when their respective trains pass each other, and they are instantly drawn to seek one another.  Each disembarks and races to find the other, finally meeting at the stairs of Suga Shrine. Taki calls out to Mitsuha, saying that he feels that he knows her, and she responds likewise. Having found what each had long searched for, they shed tears of happiness and simultaneously ask each other for their name.", "title": "Your Name", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q21697406"}}

{"id": "tt0086203", "text": "In the American release, an introduction states that a war had destroyed the human race, leading to the creation of mutant humanoid animals. \nMok, an aging yet legendary rock musician, is on the search for a very special voice whose frequencies can unleash a powerful demon from another dimension, his dwindling popularity driving him to destroy the world in vengeance and immortalize himself in the process. After travelling around the world looking for the right voice, he returns to his hometown of Ohmtown, a remote, storm-ravaged village famous for its unique power plant. Meanwhile, at a nightclub, Omar, Angel, Dizzy and Stretch perform in a small rock band. As Angel performs her romantic ballad to a mostly empty audience, Mok hears her sing; he realizes that Angel has the voice he needs when a ring he is wearing reacts to her voice. Mok invites Angel and the band to his mansion outside of town, where the band is formally introduced to him and his assistants, the \"Rollerskating Schlepper Brothers\" Toad, Sleazy and Zip. Mok incapacitates Omar and Stretch with hypnotic \"Edison Balls\" as he takes Angel on a stroll through his garden and tries to convince her to join him. Although Angel is unaware of Mok's true intentions, she refuses to abandon her band. Unwilling to admit defeat, Mok kidnaps her and takes his blimp to Nuke York, where his summoning, disguised as a concert, will be performed.\nFollowing their ejection from Mok's mansion, the band find out what happened to Angel and they follow the blimp in a stolen police car. Before they reach Nuke York, they are arrested by a border guard. Meanwhile, Angel attempts to escape with the unwitting help of Cinderella, the sister of the Schleppers. While sneaking through the ventilation system, Angel overhears Mok confirming his plans with his computer. At this time, the computer informs Mok that the only way to stop the demon is with \"One voice, one heart, one song\", but when Mok asks who can do this, the computer replies that there is \"no one\". Angel and Cindy escape the building and head to the zero-gravity dance club \"Club 666\", unaware that the Schleppers are following them. Dizzy's aunt bails out Omar and his friends, and tells them of the club. Angel and Cindy are intercepted and taken back to Mok's apartment, and the band tries to follow. Omar eventually bumps into Mok, who uses an impersonator to fool Omar into thinking that Angel has fallen for Mok. To manipulate Angel, Mok captures the band and tortures them within a giant Edison Ball to force her to agree with his demands. He also brainwashes them to ensure that they stay out of the way. The Nuke York concert turns out to be a disaster due to a power failure. Because the invocation requires a titanic amount of electricity, Mok relocates the summoning to Ohmtown, whose power plant has enough energy. Meanwhile, one of the Schlepper brothers, Zip, expresses childlike doubts about whether their actions are good or evil, and Mok rudely dismisses both his concerns and his feelings. During the concert, a power surge causes overloads all over the city. The shock also brings Omar and his friends out of their hypnosis.\nStretch finds a poster advertising Mok and Angel's concert and Dizzy sticks with him to save her. After confessing that Omar saw Mok and Angel together, Stretch tries to remind him it's all mind games. Omar, still believing Mok's earlier deception, refuses to help Dizzy and Stretch stop the concert. They go without him in a stolen police car, but crash at the concert too late, as Mok forces Angel to sing and open a portal to the demon's dimension. A massive demonic entity emerges from the portal and begins wreaking havoc on all those present, wrecking part of the ceiling and devouring two innocents. But Omar has a change of heart and arrives to free Angel from her electronic shackles before the demon can turn on her. When the demon attacks Omar, Zip sacrifices himself to save Omar's life. Angel tries singing to banish the demon, but her lone voice only pushes him back. But Omar joins in harmony with Angel, and thus the creature is weakened, injured and driven back into its own dimension. Mok is thrown into the portal by Toad who is avenging Zip's death at the demon's hands. As his attempts to climb out prove futile, he realizes that \"no one\" did not mean that the demon could not be stopped; it meant instead that \"no one voice\" could, acting alone; two voices and two hearts singing as one were needed for the counter-spell.

He is a former F-16 Falcon pilot, married, with two children who live with him in a suburban house off-base. His current assignment involves flying armed MQ-9 Reaper drones in foreign air space in support of the U.S. War on Terror. He is admired by his commanding officer and support staff for his calm demeanor, precise flying, and adaptability. Privately, he is concerned about the assignment, which he took after being informed there was reduced call for and increased competition among fighter pilots in the Air Force. His previous CO informed him that a tour flying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) would look good on his record and would increase his chances of being posted back to a flying assignment.\nAt first, the new assignment seems stressful but relatively benign. He is assigned to attack more clear-cut terrorist cells, vehicles, and facilities in Afghanistan. He flies these assignments during daylight hours over his targets, which is night-time in Las Vegas, leaving his days free for his sleep period, and to spend time with his wife and children. However, the high-tempo assignment \u2013 he is attacking targets on almost a daily basis \u2013 begins taking its toll. His wife notices the stress he's under and he begins drinking when off-duty.\nStill, his performance is excellent and his crew is rated among the highest in the squadron, so, on the orders of his commanding officer, he is assigned to more challenging missions under the direction of CIA controllers. Many of these targets are in Yemen and Somalia, places where the U.S. has no acknowledged military mission. The targets themselves are increasingly morally ambiguous: crowds the CIA controller calls terrorist cells, public buildings the controller says are sleeping spots for high level terrorist leaders or factories for making explosives. Collateral damage goes from being a rare occurrence to a routine one. On several occasions, the CIA controller orders strikes on obvious civilian targets \u2013 including women and children \u2013 describing these casualties as unfortunate but necessitated by terrorist leaders using them as human shields.\nEgan's performance declines and his drinking intensifies. He narrowly avoids being arrested for drunk driving, and starts avoiding home commitments, not wanting to inflict the stress he's under on his wife. He relishes a rare overwatch assignment protecting U.S. troops as they sleep, but must break a promise to his wife in order to perform the mission. On another overwatch mission, the troops are killed by an improvised explosive device that Egan could not protect them from. After a stress-induced violent episode at home, Egan's wife demands to know the details of Egan's work, and Egan tells her. She appears appalled. Soon after, she says she is leaving him and taking the children to Reno, Nevada, blaming his drinking and violent behavior.\nFinally, Egan cracks. His CIA controller orders a strike on a small group of civilians responding to an explosion at a building Egan had previously destroyed. Rather than obey the order, Egan simulates a glitch in the UAV control system and the targets escape. His CO has no choice but to demote him away from the attack role into a surveillance one. While on a surveillance mission, Egan notices a man whom he had previously watched rape a woman several times approaching her home. His Mission Intelligence Coordinator had previously described this man as \"a bad guy.

{"id": "tt0090498", "text": "The story begins in Houston, Texas in 1899, as Sheriff Jonathan Grail tried to round up the villainous four-man Pike Gang, of which he had once been a member.  After cornering the gang in a stormy Native American graveyard, a bolt of lightning struck all five men - transporting them 87 years forward in time to 1986.  With no way to get back to their original time, the five men agreed to a truce, and started a private investigation/detective agency to pay their bills.\nThe five men, now working as the \"Double Eagle Detection Agency,\" helped right wrongs, protected the downtrodden, and fought off drug lords and gang leaders, all while continuing to operate with 19th-century weaponry, including revolvers and shotguns.  Several of the episodes dealt with problems the men faced in the 1880s that had to be resolved in the 1980s. No one knew their real identities, and most people assumed that their old-style clothing and weapons were an affectation. During their first case they met Lt. Maggie Randall, a Houston detective, who became romantically involved with Grail and often helped them in their cases.\nThe series featured crime drama and shootouts, although the heroes never killed anyone, thanks to their superior marksmanship. The show also featured humorous moments. The humor derived primarily from the outlaws' unfamiliarity with 20th-century technology, as well as the contrast between their 19th-century mores and those of the 20th century. Most episodes featured flashbacks, which were done in a sepia tone.\nAlthough the pilot episode was one of the most-watched shows that week, future episodes drew fewer and fewer fans.  The series' final episode, in fact, featured a \"flashback\" scene from another television show, The Oregon Trail, in which Outlaws actors Rod Taylor and Charles Napier both starred.", "title": "Outlaws (1986 TV series)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q3754727"}}

he had been a student of Devereaux's and believed he had died in 1969.\nMeanwhile, Liz is stunned when she encounters first her mother, and then her future self \u2013 a cold, emotionless, scientist going by the name Beth (Mary Preston) \u2013 working in the Ice Box.\nHer father Frank is also there, but has been buried under the ice for ten years as part of an experiment, which Liz only discovers later to her disgust and horror.\nThe staff of the Ice Box are conducting controlled experiments on human volunteers, including tests of longevity drug called HA57.\nA catalogue of failures has been plaguing the research effort, but Devereaux refuses to entertain the possibility that the base computer is making errors.\nThe failures get worse, and Devereaux's behaviour becomes more and more erratic.\nLiz and Simon learn that Devereaux is a clone of the original Devereaux, the first in the world.\nInvestigating further, Liz and Simon discover that the purpose of the computer is to create a new clone of Devereaux.\nThis is so that the formula for the longevity drug, which is known only to Devereaux and not written down, can be preserved and kept secret.\nThe Ice Box researchers confront Devereaux, attempting to convince him that the computer is malfunctioning.\nDevereaux is unable to accept his failing and, suffering a mental breakdown, escapes out into the Antarctic ice.\nAs the computer fails, the base begins to freeze over.\nThe staff, including Jean and Beth, each take a dose of an anti-freeze formula in the hope of surviving the cold until rescue arrives.\nLiz and Simon depart; as they approach the Time Barrier, they discover the frozen body of Devereaux.\nIn \"The Year of the Burn Up\", the Time Barrier returns Simon and Liz to 1970.\nTraynor warns them not to use the Time Barrier again.\nDetermined to prevent the future of the Ice Box that they have witnessed, and curious as to what Traynor is afraid they might discover, they disobey him and once more enter the Time Barrier.\nOnce again, they end up in 1990, but in an alternate future to that of the Ice Box.\nIn this future, England is covered in tropical rainforest.\nOnce again, Liz encounters her future self, Beth (once more played by Mary Preston).\nThis time, however, she is a hippy Earth mother type who has rebelled against the technocracy that rules this future world, and lives in a primitive village with similar misfits.\nSimon also encounters his future self \u2013 a technocrat known as Controller 2957 (David Graham), charged with implementing the Master Plan intended to reshape the Earth to the benefit of mankind.\nThe Master Plan had originally been devised in 1970 by Traynor.\nHowever, 2957 has since usurped him, and now Traynor, who is still alive in 1990, is determined to wreak his revenge.\nTraynor sabotages the computer managing the Master Plan.\nHis interference ruins the Earth's climate, causing global temperatures to soar and leading to an environmental collapse of devastating proportions.\nBeth aids Liz and Simon in returning through the Time Barrier before heading for the safety of some caves with the misfits and 2957, who has seen the error of his ways, where there is water and they might stand a chance of survival.\nThe final serial, \"The Day of the Clone\", ties together many of the elements of the previous serials.\nBelieving that Beth needs her help, Liz attempts to return to 1990 via the Time Barrier, but is kidnapped by Traynor.\nSimon goes looking for Liz and tracks her to R1, a secret research establishment under Traynor's command.\nThe children learn that R1 was established by Morgan Devereaux to research into the longevity drug \u2013 HA57 \u2013 that the children previously encountered in the Ice Box.\nThey break out of R1 and, with Traynor in pursuit, they make their escape through the Time Barrier, which transports them to the year 1965.\nRealising that Devereaux would have been alive in this time, they return to R1.\nThere the children learn that R1 is not only researching longevity, but also cloning.\nDevereaux believes that for the cloning and longevity process to be a success, subjects must also undergo psychological reconditioning, but Traynor, who is working at R1 as the Government's representative, disagrees, believing that Devereaux is turning the volunteer subjects into brainwashed puppets.\nWhen Traynor threatens to shut down R1, Devereaux has him detained and replaced by a clone.\nSimon realises that it is Devereaux who is the source of the dystopian futures they have witnessed, and that the Traynor they know has been a clone all along.\nThe Time Barrier created a clone projection of Devereaux in the Ice Box in the hope that the children could return a working formula for HA57 to the Traynor clone in 1970.\nThe Traynor clone is also a projection of the Time Barrier, charged with implementing Devereaux's vision of the future: the catastrophic Master Plan that will lead to the \"Burn Up\".\nReturning to 1970, Liz and Simon discover the real Traynor, locked up in a secret room in R1 since 1965.\nThe children and the real Traynor confront the clone Traynor at the Time Barrier at St Oswald.\nTraynor tells the clone that he doesn't exist, that he is a projection.\nAs the clone nears the Barrier, an invisible force grabs him and he disappears into the Time Barrier.\nLiz and Simon return to their families, leaving the real Traynor alone.", "title": "Timeslip", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q7806602"}}

Meanwhile, high school senior Tripp Coley has taken up a job at a junkyard, where he builds a pickup truck in hopes of being able to leave his town. The truck doesn't have a working drivetrain. One night, Tripp encounters the escaped creature in the junkyard and captures it, but the creature escapes before he can seek authorities.\nThe next day Tripp, along with his classmate, beautiful Meredith, find the creature has a diet of oil and it takes shelter within the hood of his truck. He befriends him, names him Creech, and promises to help him get home. Tripp modifies the truck to give Creech more control as a makeshift engine. The truck acts as a 'wheelchair' for Creech to operate. Meanwhile, Tenneson is still concerned about the incident at the drilling rig, since similar experiments have revealed the existence of other creatures. He decides to protect the company's image by drilling poison into a hole leading to the underwater tunnels, and by sending hired mercenary Burke to kill their captured creatures, to the objection of Jim, as he finds the monsters have significant intelligence and emotions, as well as a hive mind intelligence that allows both of the captured specimens to learn what was taught to one.\nTripp and Meredith go see Tripp's father Wade to seek help, but Wade sells Tripp out to Burke. Tripp and Meredith escape in the truck with Creech. Tripp, Meredith and Creech are chased by Burke and his team along with Rick. Tripp, Meredith and Creech escape by jumping over a MRL local with an EMD MP15DC lead train, and camp at a hunting cabin.\nWhen Creech gets the sense something bad will happen to the other creatures, he heads to the Terravex headquarters where the other creatures are being held captive. Tripp and Meredith follow Creech. When they arrive, they find Creech's parents, but are attacked by Terravex workers. Creech arrives and is captured; Tripp and Meredith are taken to Tenneson.\nJim decides to help Tripp and Meredith rescue the creatures. They acquire two more trucks.

On the way, Rick helps Tripp and the group escape from Burke, preventing Burke from ramming them off the road and later stealing a large truck to block the road to prevent further pursuit. After realizing the poison has been inserted, Tripp gets into a head-on battle with Burke, who attempts to push him into the drilling hole, but ends when Tripp and Creech overturn Burke's truck, destroying the poison machine and killing Burke when his truck is thrown into the equipment. Creech saves Tripp from drowning before he and his parents depart back home and Terravex is exposed by the group for the experimentation that was harming the creatures' habitat.

Other characters were Betty Brant, a stenographer at the Bugle, and J. Jonah Jameson, the newspaper's editor. Later programs starring or featuring _Spider-Man_ (qv) included \"The Electric Company\" (about two dozen three-minute segments were produced, featuring that show's cast as the villians and supporting characters); a new animated series, \"_Spider-Man_ (qv) and his Amazing Friends\" (and later, shared billing with the Incredible Hulk) that aired on NBC in the 1980s; and another new animated version of _Spider-Man_ (qv) on Fox's children's schedule, starting in 1995.::Brian Rathjen <briguy_52732@yahoo.com>", "title": "Spider-Man (1967 TV series)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q2333456"}}

In his attempt to prevent Paradigm from using this machine for personal power, Bolton is transformed into an unseen monstrosity, but escapes. Later, Paradigm gives Bolton's four sons John, Bobby, Coop, and Clint the likeness of four different sharks. When Dr. Paradigm captures their friend Bends, the resulting \"Street Sharks\" rescue him and the resulting battle causes Paradigm to be combined with piranha DNA (for which he is often nicknamed \"Dr. Piranoid\" by other characters). In subsequent episodes, Dr. Paradigm creates a variety of mutant animals to destroy the Street Sharks while attempting to persuade the inhabitants of their native metropolis of Fission City to imprison them. Of these mutant animals, a few sided with the Sharks themselves: namely Rox, Moby Lick, Mantaman, and El Swordo.\nThe final few episodes introduced the Dino Vengers: a group of extraterrestrial dinosaurs allied with the Street Sharks against their own rivals in the Raptor Gang. When Dr. Paradigm wanted to get a sample of the Raptors' DNA to improve himself, they trick him by giving him iguana DNA which transforms him into \"Dr. Iguanazoid\" leading to him working with the Raptors where they will reward him by correcting the DNA mistake they gave him. In the end, Paradigm is captured and imprisoned while the Raptor Gang leaves Earth.\nThe Dino Vengers later had their own series called Extreme Dinosaurs where they and the Raptors had different backgrounds.", "title": "Street Sharks", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q130728"}}

days, Pea Eye Parker (Tim Scott), another former Ranger who works hard but isn't very bright, and Bol\u00edvar (Le\u00f3n Singer), a retired Mexican bandit who is their cook.\nAlso living with them is Newt Dobbs (Ricky Schroder), a 17-year-old whose mother was a prostitute named Maggie and whose father may be Call.\nThe story begins in the small Texas town of Lonesome Dove, as Jake Spoon (Robert Urich), a former Texas Ranger and comrade of Gus and Call's, shows up after an absence of more than ten years.\nHe reveals that he is a man on the run, a fugitive, after having accidentally shot the dentist and mayor of Fort Smith, Arkansas, in a bar-room gunfight.\nThe dentist/mayor's brother happens to be the sheriff, July Johnson (Chris Cooper).\nReunited with Gus and Call, Jake's glowing

been \"civilized\".\nAt the continued insistence of the dentist's widow, Sheriff Johnson sets off in pursuit of Spoon, accompanied by his young stepson Joe who travels at the request of Joe's mother and Sheriff Johnson's wife Elmira (Glenne Headly).\nOnce her son and husband have left for Texas, Elmira leaves Fort Smith for Ogallala, Nebraska, to meet up with her first husband and Joe's father, Dee Boot.\nSailing up the Arkansas River on a whiskey boat, she falls in with a group of buffalo hunters.\nMeanwhile, the men of Lonesome Dove make preparations for their adventure north, including stealing 2,500 horses and cattle from across the Rio Grande in Mexico, befriending two lost Irish immigrants, Allan and Sean O'Brien, and being joined by nearly all of the male citizens of the town.\nBefore leaving, Gus returns to fetch his livery sign and say farewell to his pigs, who end up following him anyway.\nBack in Fort Smith, Peach (widowed from Jake's shooting) insists that Roscoe (July's timid Deputy) has to find July not only to inform him that his wife's run off but that she is pregnant.\nJake decides not to travel with the herd, mainly because he promises to take the town's

knocks Newt unconscious, kidnaps Lorie, and attempts to sell/barter her to a gang of Comanchero bandits camped on the Llano Estacado.\nKnowing that Gus is in pursuit, Blue Duck asks the Comanchero bandit gang to kill Gus when he arrives - the reward of doing so being Lorie.\nGus and the bandits engage in a brief gun battle that quickly turns into a stalemate.\nGus, having killed his horse, is pinned down by the bandits' gunfire until nightfall, when Sheriff Johnson's party arrives and scares them off.\nSheriff Johnson, despite Gus' protests, joins Gus in the rescue of Lorie.\nThe pair then ride to a hilltop above the Comancheros camp.\nAfter a brief one-sided gunfight, in which Gus kills all of Blue Duck's gang, Lorie is rescued.\nBut while Gus and Johnson are away, Blue Duck uses his

horses.\nThey then travel to a sodbuster's farm, two of whom the leader kills, hangs, and burns for no apparent reason.\nAlthough Spoon disagrees, the gang leader bullies Spoon into submission.\nWhen

on across the Powder River, Montana Territory.\nMeanwhile, Clara's husband finally dies and is buried as well.\nLeaving the main group to scout ahead with Pea Eye Parker, Gus decides to pursue some buffalo, but is chased by mounted Indians and is badly wounded in his right leg.\nWhile trying to get back to the herd for help, an exhausted Pea Eye is guided by the ghost of Deets, whereas Gus is found by a stranger and taken 40 miles away to Miles City, Montana.\nThere a doctor amputates Gus' right leg.\nGus knows that his left leg is septic and he is likely to die, but refuses to let the doctor remove it too.\nGus tells Call (who has come in search of him) to give his money to Lorie, to bury him in Texas, and to admit that Call is Newt's father.\nCall arranges to store Gus' body in

and Gus had on each other, blaming their adventures as the reason neither of them could find happiness.\nAfter a long journey, Call arrives at Santa Rosa, New Mexico Territory, the town where Blue Duck has finally been captured.\nCall visits Blue Duck in jail, where Blue Duck mocks Call's failure to capture him.\nWhile being led to the gallows, Blue Duck grabs deputy Robert Hofer and throws himself out a window, choosing a murder-suicide rather than allow himself to be hanged.\nDespite blizzards, a broken wagon, and the loss of the coffin, Call finally succeeds in burying Gus after a journey of some three thousand miles.\nCall weeps for his friend after burying him, the first display of emotion he has allowed himself since Deets' death.\nAfter the burial, Call tours Lonesome Dove,

She wishes to work and save enough money to buy a tin roof for the house, while her mother encourages her to finish her schooling. A period of heavy rain causes the rice fields to become swamped and damages all remaining crops, leaving the family without a source of income. While attending a village festival, Lakshmi meets Bimla, a foreign woman who entices her with stories of the city and offers her a job in India as a maid. Lakshmi's mother rejects the proposal, but her father reveals that he has already agreed and accepted money from Bimla, out of desperation.\nLakshmi and Bimla pass the border without incident and arrive at their destination, a building known as 'Happiness House', which is a brothel run by a woman named Mumtaz. Unaware that she has been sold into sexual slavery, Lakshmi mingles with the other girls at the brothel, including Shahanna and Anita, who she befriends; and the temperamental Monica. Later that night, she is dressed and prepared for Varun, an important and high-paying customer who has a preference for virgins. Resisting his advances, Lakshmi bites Varun and uses the ensuing chaos to escape the building. On the street, she blindly runs for help but is caught and beaten by Mumtaz's workers, who subsequently lock her in an isolated room. While looking out of the window, Lakshmi is spotted by Sophia, an American photographer who has arrived in India to work with an anti-trafficking organisation, Hope House. Sophia takes pictures of Lakshmi, but she is noticed by a brothel worker, Suren, who breaks her camera. After recovering the photos, Sophia becomes determined to save 'the girl in the window', and requests help from Hope House manager Mrs. Tripathi, and her investigators Vikram and Sam.\nAfter multiple failed attempts to ensure her cooperation, Mumtaz drugs Lakshmi's mango juice and prepares her once again for Varun, who rapes her. The next day, she is drugged again and forced to service multiple men. Sophia asks Vikram to raid Happiness House, but he is reluctant to do so without proper planning. No longer new, Lakshmi is given a bed in the communal living space and made to work as the other women do. She befriends Harish, a young boy living at the brothel with his infant sister Gina and mother Pushpa, who is a sickly prostitute. After witnessing workers bury a body in a shallow grave, Lakshmi contemplates suicide but is stopped by Shahanna. Days pass and soon Lakshmi becomes resigned to her fate. She calculates the number of days needed for her to pay off her debt to Mumtaz, but is discouraged by Shahanna, who warns her that there will be consequences if her notes are found. Anita tries to escape, and is punished by Mumtaz, who shoves chilli peppers into her vagina in front of the others. Lakshmi saves Shahanna after she is attacked by an irate customer, and Bimla informs her that the bodies of those who die on the premises are buried in the garden. Monica, who has managed to pay back her debt to Mumtaz after five years, leaves the brothel and returns to her village, where she expects to be welcomed as a heroine since she has been financially providing for her family. Vikram and Sam arrive at Happiness House, posing as customers. Sam gives Lakshmi a card containing the details of Hope House and informs her that a raid will be held soon. The exchange is overheard by Anita. Lakshmi confides in Shahanna, who is dismissive and claims that American men are sent to kidnap girls and harvest their organs. A bruised and battered Monica returns to Happiness House, having been beaten by her father and thrown out of her village. A week later, the women are taken to see a doctor, who examines them and discovers that Monica has Kaposi's sarcoma, a symptom of HIV/AIDS. She is forced to leave the brothel.\nWhile delivering soft drinks to customers, Harish sees Lakshmi in the garden and offers her a bottle. They hide from Suren, who comes looking for Harish and the missing crate of drinks. Anita witnesses the scene and causes a power outage, which stops the pair being found and punished. Mumtaz confronts the women about the power cut, and finds the Hope House card. Anita falsely claims it is hers and is struck by Mumtaz, but she is able to return the card to Lakshmi and tells her that she lied to buy time for the upcoming raid. The raid begins but the police and Sam find nothing since the younger girls are hidden away by Bimla. Sophia apologizes to Vikram for pushing him to conduct a premature search. Anita is sold by Mumtaz to the Middle East, where she will be a sex slave and never be able to return. Pushpa becomes increasingly sick and is forced to leave with Harish and Gina, since she can no longer work. Lakshmi begins to plan her escape, and manages to slip out of a window while the others are watching a religious festival on TV. She is chased by one of the brothel workers but manages to escape in the thick crowds of worshipers. After initially getting lost, Lakshmi finally makes her way to Hope House and is reunited with Harish. Using her information, the police conduct a surprise raid on Happiness House, and find the hidden girls and buried bodies. Bimla, Suren and others are arrested, but Mumtaz gets away.

His young daughter is left traumatized after being taken hostage in a gun battle, and his wife Ching-fang is filing for divorce. Huang is on the verge of a severe nervous breakdown.\nA series of bizarre deaths in Taipei baffle local investigators, including a Catholic priest of foreign nationality found disemboweled. The priest is involved in the Taiwan-US military trade, so FBI agent Kevin Richter is called in to help. Huang, who can speak English, is made his liaison. Kevin, the topmost serial killer expert in the field, was previously investigating a series of murders in US in which all victims appeared willing to die.\nThe crime scenes imply the involvement of supernatural forces. In one case a businessman froze to death in his office in the middle of a heatwave; in another the mistress of a prominent official called the fire department and was later found burned to death - with no sign of a fire ever occurring in her apartment. Richter is skeptical but Huang, who is more receptive to supernatural possibilities, suggests they investigate a local cult. After consulting a scholar in Academia Sinica, Huang and Kevin find that the killings follow a Taoist belief that one must fulfill five forms of suffering required to become a Xian, an immortal being. According to legends, the one who can perform the five rituals is born with double pupils in one eye.\nThey also find that all victims have done something against their conscience, and that a kind of fungus was used to induce hallucination, pleasure and guilt which made the victims kill themselves. An advanced technology was used to spread the fungus, and the Police trace this technology to two bosses of an electronics company in Hsinchu Science Park. The men has spent their fortune and technology to move a Taoist temple into their company, where many cult believers gather. The police enter the temple, but the cultists perform a ritualistic massacre, killing many officers and cultists alike. After the massacre Kevin and Huang find a seemingly innocent girl who survived, and the case is closed.\nThe next day Huang finds Kevin dead, having pulled out his own tongue, which is the fifth suffering required. Huang finds that both he and Kevin were infected with the fungus by the girl. Huang begins to hallucinate, tormented by the guilt he feels for his wife and daughter, and returns to the temple to confront the girl survivor, who is revealed to be the cult's leader. The girl has the double double pupil in her eye and believes that by having Huang kill her, she can complete the fifth requirement and become immortal.

When the inspector invites Margaret to a vice squad party, Stanley launches an attack on him.\nStanley wishes for a quiet life in the countryside, with children, and Margaret making the anniversary dinner. It soon becomes apparent, however, that Margaret is another man's wife. While deeply in love, even the attempt to consummate their affection drives both Stanley and Margaret into emotional agony.\nStanley attempts to frame a sixth wish that George cannot ruin for him. He wishes that he and Margaret loved one another, lived away from the big city, and would always be together. However, George turns him into a nun of the Order of Saint Beryl, or the Leaping Beryllians, who glorify their founder by jumping on trampolines (expanding on a sketch that previously appeared in Cook and Moore's TV show Not Only... But Also).  Margaret is also a nun in the order, but refuses to consider consummating their love as they are both women. Stanley attempts to escape the wish by blowing a raspberry, to no effect, and he returns to London to confront George.\nWhen Stanley tries to use his seventh wish, George reveals he has already used it: his trial wish for an ice lolly.Ultimately, Spiggott spares Stanley eternal damnation because he has exceeded his quota of 100 billion souls and can afford to be generous. Stanley is duly returned to his old job and life, wiser and more clear-sighted. Spiggott ascends to Heaven to meet God, but is rejected again; St Peter explains that when he gave Stanley back his soul, Spiggott did the right thing, but with the wrong motive.\nIn the closing scene, Stanley and Margaret are back in the restaurant. Stanley finally asks her out but she says she's already doing something, though she does suggest perhaps another night. Stanley smiles, happy that he has found the courage to talk to her.  Spiggott tries to entice Stanley again, but Stanley turns him down. Frustrated, Spiggott leaves and threatens revenge on God by unleashing all the tawdry and shallow technological curses of the modern age.", "title": "Bedazzled (1967 film)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q934251"}}

Drew and head coach Vince Penn \u2014 along with Weaver's mother \u2014 are exceptions.\nPenn agrees that Callahan is excellent but does not want to teach a rookie quarterback his system of offense.\nHe much prefers to keep Drew at quarterback and wants Weaver to draft running back Ray Jennings of Florida State, whose father had starred for the Browns.\nDrew, who led the team to a 5\u20131 start the previous year before his injury, fears losing his job as the Browns' quarterback now that the Browns can pick Callahan.\nHe trained hard in the off season recovering from his injury and greatly improving his leg strength and his throwing arm.\nDrew is so \"upset\" he trashes Weaver's office.\nThe Browns' trade for the number one pick leaks public after a tweet by linebacker Vontae Mack of Ohio State, who had been Weaver's preference for their now-gone seventh pick.\nMack, whose good character is established through side-plot vignettes with his family, wants to play for the Browns, and now fears not being chosen until much later in the first round.\nHe advises Weaver to rewatch the Ohio State vs.\nWisconsin game in which Ohio State was defeated, but Mack sacked Callahan four times.\nTeams contact Weaver for possible transactions based on the trade; one from the Houston Texans implies that Mack will not remain available to the Browns in the second round.\nAfter rewatching some plays from Callahan's game against Mack, Weaver becomes concerned about Callahan's ability under pressure.\nWeaver also doubts Callahan's character when he learns from his security chief about a report that none of Callahan's teammates attended his big 21st birthday party, and that Callahan allegedly had lied to the Washington Redskins about reading the whole of that team's playbook.\nCallahan hadn't noticed the Redskins had taped a $100 bill to the last page of the playbook, and Weaver is told that, by way of contrast, Brian Drew's response to the $100-bill trick had been exemplary.\nWhen the draft begins that evening at Radio City Music Hall, the Browns have ten minutes to make the first overall pick.\nDistracted by his personal relationship with Parker and his mother Barb's untimely wish to spread his dad's ashes on the practice field that day, Weaver agonizes until the final minute over whom to select with his number-one pick.\nHe abruptly chooses Mack, whom he wanted all along and whom he could have gotten with his original seventh pick, without giving up successive first-round draft choices.\nRoger Goodell's announcement of the selection amazes the league and the front office.\nWhile a relieved Drew believes that his job is safe, Molina becomes irate and flies back to Cleveland.\nCallahan has an anxiety attack, and storms out of the theater until his agent, Chris Crawford, persuades him to return and not show panic.\nPenn is incensed and threatens to quit as coach.\nWeaver's unexpected choice, however, disrupts the draft.\nRumors spread about Callahan as other teams avoid him, fearing that the Browns know something they do not.\nIt now appears the Seahawks still might be able to select Callahan with what had been the Browns' seventh pick.\nHowever, the Jacksonville Jaguars hold the sixth pick.\nThe Jaguars' first two choices are no longer available, so their draft plans are in disarray, and their rookie general manager Jeff Carson is wary about Callahan because of the rumors.\nWeaver persuades the Jaguars to trade him their sixth pick for the next three years of the Browns' second-round draft picks.\nMolina arrives and angrily confronts Weaver, who asks the owner to wait five more minutes and let him do his job.\nWeaver then calls Michaels, who now wants Callahan, since he is under increasing pressure from Seahawk fans after trading away the number-one pick.\nWeaver demands all three of his former first-round draft picks back, plus the Seahawks' punt returner, David Putney, in exchange for the sixth pick.\nThe Seahawks make the deal and choose Callahan with the sixth pick, thus getting him for about $7 million less than if the Seahawks had made him their first overall selection.\nWeaver then selects Jennings with his restored seventh pick, appeasing coach Penn and owner Molina.\nWeaver effectively has acquired Mack, Jennings and Putney expending only three years of second-round picks.\nThis is universally acclaimed as an outstanding draft for the Browns.\nAdditionally, in Drew the Browns have an experienced and fully healthy returning quarterback.\nAfter the Brown's draft party, Weaver and Parker meet Weaver's mother, Barb, in a hallway, and the three reconcile over Weaver's excellent draft and Barb's upcoming first grandchild.\nWeaver and a visibly pregnant Parker attend the opening day of the 2014 season at FirstEnergy Stadium.\nWeaver laughs as he overhears retired Browns stars Jim Brown and Bernie Kosar congratulate Molina for doing \"a hell of a job\" with the draft and then hears Molina accept the credit.\nThe team \u2014 including Mack, Jennings, Drew and Putney \u2014 explodes onto the field on opening day.", "title": "Draft Day", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q15985322"}}

{"id": "tt6053438", "text": "Ernst Toller is the pastor of the First Reformed Church in Snowbridge, New York, who is struggling with a crisis of faith. The film opens with him writing down his thoughts in a journal, which he plans to keep for a year, and then destroy. He leads a 250-year-old Dutch Reformed Church which was once a stop on the Underground Railroad. It faces dwindling attendance under Toller's leadership, which has taken the church away from its historical focus on Calvinist theology; it now serves mostly as a tourist attraction. Toller, a former military chaplain, is also struggling with the death of his son Joseph, who was killed in the Iraq War, and with alcoholism. Toller seeks a deeper spiritual understanding through reading Roman Catholic writers (G. K. Chesterton and Thomas Merton) and mystical books (The Cloud of Unknowing). This leads him to seek support from Abundant Life, the evangelical megachurch in Albany that owns First Reformed.\nHe is approached by Mary, who is seeking counseling for Michael, her radical-environmentalist husband. Michael further challenges Toller's beliefs: he explains that he wants Mary to get an abortion, because he does not want to bring a child into a world that will be rendered almost uninhabitable by climate change. Mary finds a suicide vest belonging to her husband in their garage. Toller takes it, promising to counsel Michael about it. Mary and Toller discuss going to the police, but Toller feels it would worsen Michael's state. Just before their next appointment, Michael sends Toller a text message asking to meet in a local park. Toller arrives to find Michael dead of a self-inflicted shotgun wound. In accordance with Michael's will and testament, a service is held at a local toxic-waste dump, where his ashes are scattered.\nMeanwhile, plans are underway to celebrate the 250th anniversary of First Reformed with a service attended by the mayor, the governor, and Edward Balq, one of Abundant Life's key financial backers and the owner of a polluting factory. At a meeting in a diner, Balq takes issue with Toller honoring Michael's will and deems it a political act, and the two argue over climate change: Balq dismisses it as \"complicated\", but Toller sees it as a straightforward matter of Christian stewardship.\nExperiencing physical pain, Toller reluctantly sees a doctor, who suspects stomach cancer and schedules some tests. Toller has Michael's laptop computer, which he took after Michael's suicide to prevent the police from discovering Michael's radicalism and making trouble for Mary. He uses it to research Michael's concerns, including the materials on Balq's factory which inspired him to make the explosive vest. One night, Mary visits Toller in the parsonage of the church, and he plays Michael's role in a nonsexual rite of physical intimacy that the couple used to perform.\nToller begs Mary not to attend the anniversary service. Preparing for his role in the ceremony, he puts on the explosive vest, and arms it. When he sees Mary entering for the ceremony, he removes the vest and instead wraps himself in barbed wire under his alb.

With no adults around, Telly, who is a few years older, persuades the girl, who is a virgin, to have sex with him. Afterwards, he meets with his best friend, Casper, and they talk about his sexual experience. Telly vocalizes his desire to keep having sex with virginal girls. The pair then enters a local store, where Casper shoplifts a 40 oz. bottle of malt liquor as Telly distracts the cashier. Looking for drugs, food, and a place to hang out, they head to their friend Paul's apartment, despite expressing their dislike of him on the way there. Once they arrive at Paul's house, they join the other boys in boasting about their sexual prowess, as well as their nonchalant attitudes to both unprotected sex and venereal diseases. While doing so, the boys smoke marijuana while watching a skating video. Casper inhales nitrous oxide out of balloons, which Telly considers dangerous.\nAcross the city, a group of girls, among them Ruby and Jennie, are talking about sex. Their attitudes evidently contradict that of the boys on many topics, particularly oral sex and the significance of the individuals to whom they lost their virginities. Ruby and Jennie mention that they were recently tested for STDs at Ruby's request, though Jennie only got tested to keep Ruby company. Ruby's test is negative, though she has had multiple sexual encounters, many of them unprotected intercourse.\nJennie tests positive for HIV. She tells the nurse that she has had sex only once, with Telly. Distraught over her results, Jennie spends the rest of the day trying to find Telly, to prevent him from passing the virus on to another girl. Meanwhile, Telly and Casper walk to Telly's house and steal money from Telly's mother, who is preoccupied with taking care of her new baby.\nThey go to Washington Square Park and purchase a dime bag of marijuana from a rastafarian. They then meet up with a few friends to talk and smoke, one of whom gives a blunt-rolling tutorial. During the hangout, Casper and many others taunt a homosexual couple passing through the park. On the side, Telly briefly talks to Misha, a girl who strongly dislikes Casper and calls him a jerk.\nAs Casper rides on a skateboard, he carelessly bumps into a man, who angrily threatens and pushes Casper. The man is struck in the back of the head with a skateboard by Casper's friend Harold, causing him to collapse. A number of other skaters join in, beating, stomping, and hitting the man with their skateboards until he is rendered unconscious by a final blow to the head by Casper.\nWhile discussing whether or not they killed the man at the park, Telly and some of the group pick up a 13-year-old girl named Darcy\u2014 the virginal younger sister of an acquaintance\u2014 with whom Telly wants to have sex. He successfully convinces her to accompany them to a public pool. The other girls engage in kissing and flirtation, but Darcy shows restraint. Afterwards, the group goes to an unsupervised party at the house of another friend, named Steven.\nMeanwhile, Jennie makes her way to Washington Square Park where she speaks to Misha, who tells her about Telly's possible whereabouts at \"N.A.S.A.\". When Jennie arrives at the club, she runs into Fidget, a raver boy, who shoves a pill into her mouth, which he says is supposed to make \"Special K look weak\". The drug turns out to be a depressant. Once its effects set in, Jennie discovers that Telly is at the party at Steven's house.\nJennie arrives at the party only to learn she is too late, as she discovers Telly having sex with Darcy, thus exposing her to HIV. Emotionally drained and still under the influence, Jennie cries and passes out on a couch among the other sleeping partygoers. A drunk Casper then rapes Jennie unprotected as she sleeps, exposing himself to HIV. Another teen at the party was able to witness the assault.

He is ultimately charged with heresy and must confront the ruling Cardinals and Princes, urging them to make the Scriptures available to the common believer and lead the Church toward faith through justice and righteousness.::scgary66\n\nThe movie starts off with Martin _Luther_ (qv) (Joseph Fiennes) trying to escape a severe storm. He promises to become a monk if God lets him live through the storm. He survives and becomes a monk. He goes to Rome to deliver a priest's letters and sees how corrupt Rome has become. He buys an indulgence for his grandfather, Hendrick _Luther_ (qv). He is told, \"Hendrick will be released from Purgatory and into the gates of heaven.\" He realizes that things shouldn't be this way, and goes back to Germany to talk to the priest. The priest sends him to Wittenberg to do a doctorate in theology. The priest believes that Martin will be able to \"change minds and open eyes\" in Wittenberg. Martin often goes to confession and becomes really aggravated with himself. He wants society to perceive things differently, such as the burial of a suicidal child outside sacred grounds, and he preaches in a church and tells everyone how his views toward God have changed. He lectures in his theology class and makes fun of indulgences and the money that Prince Frederick (Sir Peter Ustinov) collects. The Prince's secretary, Spalatin (Benjamin Sadler), warns _Luther_ (qv) that he should stop embarrassing the Prince, because he is the one paying for him at the University. After seeing the effects of the preaching of John Tetzel (Alfred Molina), Martin _Luther_ (qv) comes up with the 95 Theses and nails them onto the door of the church. Bystanders take the theses and use a printing press to turn them into books. This allows everyone to have a copy, and his ideas spread faster and easier. Pope Leo X (Uwe Ochsenknecht) thinks that Martin is a drunken German monk who will change his ideas when he becomes sober. Spalatin tells _Luther_ (qv) that he is threatened with excommunication and is summoned to appear in Augsburg by Rome. Girolamo Aleander (Jonathan Firth) prepares Martin and tells him that all he should say in front of Cardinal Cajetan (Mathieu Carri\u00e8re) is that he recants, but Martin doesn't follow through. Pope Leo X orders Martin's books to be burned, and _Luther_ (qv) is excommunicated. Then, Martin translates the New Testament into German, because he believes that the common people need to be able to understand the scriptures. In Worms, Martin is given a hearing, and when he is asked if he will recant, he asks for one day to ponder his answer. That night, he goes to confession. The next day he refuses to recant. The Cardinal demands that Martin be delivered to Rome, but Prince Frederick doesn't want that, so he kidnaps _Luther_ (qv) and keeps him in Wartburg Castle.

Explaining the extra weight will affect his precisely planned getaway, he refuses to drive until, in desperation, the leader kills one of his men who is pushed out of the car. Later they offer more money for Frank to drive them to Avignon. He refuses the deal. The robbers escape in another car but are foiled by their amateur driving.\nAt Frank's villa on the French Riviera, local Police Inspector Tarconi questions Frank about the black BMW that fled the scene of a robbery Frank was a getaway driver for. However, lacking any real proof, Tarconi leaves. Frank is then hired to deliver a package of 50 kilograms (110 lb) to an American, Darren \"Wall Street\" Bettencourt, that is loaded into Frank's trunk.

As he stops to buy drinks for the cops in his trunk, a bomb hidden in the briefcase explodes. Out for vengeance, Frank returns to Bettencourt's villa where he kills and wounds several henchmen. Frank then steals a car (a Mercedes-Benz S-Klasse) to get away, only to find \"the package\" bound and gagged in the back seat. He brings the young woman, whose name is Lai, back to his house.\nBettencourt visits one of his surviving men in hospital in order to determine who attacked his residence, before killing the man after discovering that Frank is alive. The next day, Tarconi arrives and asks about Frank's car, which Frank claims was stolen. Lai supports Frank's alibi by introducing herself as his new cook and girlfriend. Tarconi again leaves with no concrete evidence. Shortly after, Bettencourt's hitmen fire missiles and automatic weapons down on the house. Frank and Lai barely escape through an underwater passage to a nearby safe house where they end up having sex.\nLater, while being questioned at the police station, Lai accesses Tarconi's computer to find information on Bettencourt. Frank, presumed dead by Bettencourt wants to rebuild his villa and start a new life and advises Lai to do so too before she tells him that Bettencourt is a human trafficker with 400 Chinese trapped in shipping containers,  including her family. Lai and Frank go to Bettencourt's office, where Bettencourt reveals that Lai's father, Kwai, is also a human trafficker and Bettencourt's partner in crime. Kwai arrives and his henchmen subdue Frank. When Tarconi arrives, Kwai and Bettencourt accuse Frank of kidnapping Lai. Tarconi has Frank arrested and locked up in the station.\nRealizing Frank would not be constrained by search warrants and that he would be able to solve the case faster than the police, Tarconi agrees to aid Frank's escape as his faux hostage and releases him at the harbour of Cassis. Frank then tracks the criminals to the docks in Marseille, where they load the containers onto trucks. However, Frank is spotted and forced to fight his way through the guards, and fails to stop the trucks. He then steals an old car and makes chase at dawn before it breaks down on small country road. He then commandeers a small airplane from a farmer and follows the highway to the trucks where he parachutes onto one of them.

Excusing himself, Top Cat quickly runs after the female cat, interrupted by Griswald, but soon gets him out of the way and meets up with the female cat, who introduces herself as Trixie. While she finds him amusing, an alley cat isn't her type.\nAt the alley, Top Cat catches news of the Maharajah of Peekajoo, known for his generosity and his rubies are just what Top Cat needs to impress Trixie. Top Cat and his gang head to the Connity Hall to meet the Maharajah, running into an obnoxious man named Lou Strickland. The gang steal his tickets and get him sent away. While the gang distracts Officer Dibble who is the Maharaja's escort, Top Cat makes a bet with the Maharaja and gets out of him a Maharaja Talk 5000 device with many functions, as the Maharaja hasn't any rubies.\nThe next morning, Officer Dibble is summoned to the police station to work for the Chief's son-in-law Strickland, who is taking over for the retired Chief. Strickland has replaced the staff with robots which he believes are more competent. Top Cat thwarts Strickland's attempt to evict him, preventing Strickland from getting the Mayor's funding for a robot police army. Upon discovering that they met, Strickland uses Trixie to keep Top Cat away from the alley while he carries out his revenge plan. Top Cat returns to the alley getting shunned by his gang, arrested by police and after a very brief trial (due to the judge having seen the false evidence before), convicted to the Dog Jail on a charge of stealing money from an orphanage.\nWith the arrest of Top Cat, Strickland is granted the Mayor's funding and establishes a robot police army and a major scale surveillance camera system that restricts privacy for the city. Meanwhile, Top Cat tries to keep a low profile in dog jail but later becomes popular having turned the jail into a paradise for the convicts. As for Top Cat's gang, they are struggling and begin to express their disbelief in him, which Top Cat notices from one of the security cameras.\nStrickland abuses his authority and starts coming up with ridiculous laws to take absurd amounts of money off people for everything they do, intending to spend it on making himself even more 'handsome'. Tired of Strickland's tyranny, Trixie quits her job and turns to Officer Dibble, showing him evidence that a robot Top Cat was sent by Strickland robbed the orphanage, proving Top Cat's innocence. However, Strickland arrives and reveals his true intentions to Dibble, and that he's not the old chief's son-in-law. Dibble escapes to pass this to Top Cat's gang, but Trixie is captured by the police robots.\nAfter Dibble tells the gang what really happened, they all head for Big Gus to help them break Top Cat out of prison, as he owes Top Cat. Big Gus leads them through an underground passage to the dog jail and leaves. The gang apologizes for their doubts about Top Cat. With their cover blown by the dogs knowing they've got cats with them, the gang and Dibble escape through a sewer hole arriving at Strickland's HQ.\nThe gang infiltrates the building in robot guises finding Strickland has imprisoned everyone in the city and stolen the city's cash. While Dibble distracts Strickland, the gang under the guise of robots make their way to Strickland's control center, but Top Cat's gang are locked in Strickland's vault having tripped a silent alarm, with Top Cat remaining outside. When Strickland arrives, he orders Top Cat to be annihilated by the robots. As a single robot enters, Top Cat realizes the whole security system was manufactured by the Maharajah of Peekajoo. Top Cat takes out the Maharajah Talk 5000 which presumably controls all robots to get Strickland. In a panic, Strickland self-destructs the robot army except for the single one, revealed to be Fancy-Fancy still in his robot guise. Everyone imprisoned and Top Cat's gang are released in the self-destruction process. Strickland is rendered helpless and Dibble arrests him and (on Top Cat's suggestion) sentences him to the Dog Jail.\nTop Cat and Trixie renew their relationship, Officer Dibble is promoted as the new Chief of Police, the gang enjoys themselves, and finally, Griswald asks for a place in Top Cat's gang, which Top Cat accepts.", "title": "Top Cat: The Movie", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q3084652"}}
{"id": "tt0387658", "text": "The film begins with Turaga Vakama describing a land that existed before Mata Nui called Metru Nui, where the local Toa heroes fell in battle one by one as a relentless shadow sought to conquer the great city.\nLhikan, the last remaining Toa, travels throughout the entire city, giving Toa stones containing fractions of his own power to six Matoran from each of the city's different regions: Whenua, Nuju, Matau, Onewa, Nokama, and Vakama.  After giving the last stone to Vakama, Lhikan is captured by two Dark Hunters, Nidhiki and Krekka. Vakama later meets the other Matoran at the Great Temple in Ga-Metru; there, they are transformed into six new Toa. After Vakama has a vision of Metru Nui's destruction, they all set out to recover the six Great Disks hidden throughout Metru Nui, hoping to prove to Turaga Dume, the city's leader, that they are worthy Toa.  However, Dume declares that \"simple gifts\" will not confirm them as Toa, and puts them to a grueling test instead.  When the six fail to pass, Dume denounces them as imposters and unleashes the Vahki, the city's law enforcers, upon them. In the ensuing chaos, Onewa, Nuju, and Whenua are captured while Vakama and the others escape the Coliseum by leaping into the city's chute transport system, with the Dark Hunters in pursuit.\nThe Dark Hunters force a chute worker to reverse the flow of the chute system, forcing Vakama and the others to abandon the chute system in the ice region of Ko-Metru. They then set out to find the other Toa and Lhikan, whom Vakama believes is still alive. They hitch a ride on a Vahki transport to Po-Metru, where they are ambushed by the Dark Hunters and forced to flee from a herd of Kikanalo beasts. Nokama discovers that her mask allows her to speak and understand foreign languages and persuades the Kikanalo to help them find Lhikan; Matau discovers his mask power of shape-shifting along the way.\nMeanwhile, Onewa, Whenua, and Nuju are trying unsuccessfully to escape when they are approached by a mysterious Turaga, who explains that Toa mask powers are needed to escape and teaches them how to activate them. Growing impatient, the Toa argue until Onewa's mind-control and Nuju's telekinesis mask powers activate, and Nuju uses his to create an escape route.  Whenua then discovers his mask power of night vision before the four reunite with Vakama, Nokama, and Matau. The Turaga then reveals himself to be Lhikan, who sacrificed his power to turn Vakama and company into Toa. He inquires as to the safety of the 'Heart of Metru Nui', which Vakama believed was Lhikan himself, but is actually the Matoran. Vakama then discovers a small canister that contains the real Dume; the Dume from before was an impostor.  Pursued by the Vahki, the Toa, along with Lhikan, set out to stop the false Dume, who has summoned the Matoran to the Coliseum to be placed in canisters to sleep. The false Dume reveals himself to be Makuta in disguise, and plunges the Great Spirit Mata Nui into slumber. The Toa gather as many Matoran capsules as they can and race to escape the crumbling city.  On their way out, the Dark Hunters attack them again, but are killed, along with a Nivawk (Makuta's spy), when Makuta absorbs them.\nAs the group leaves Metru Nui, Vakama creates the legendary Mask of Time, which he unsuccessfully tried to do as a Matoran, from the Great Disks. Makuta pursues Lhikan is killed while protecting Vakama in the ensuing battle. In an anguished rage, Vakama knocks the Mask of Time into the sea and defeats Makuta in combat using his newfound concealment mask power.  The Toa combine their powers to seal Makuta in a protodermis prison and move on to the surface, emerging on an island they name 'Mata Nui', in honor of the Great Spirit. There, they sacrifice their Toa power to awaken the Matoran and become Turaga.

Sait\u014d Kageyu (Rentar\u014d Mikuni), the Daimyo's senior counselor, tells Hanshir\u014d the story of another r\u014dnin, Chijiiwa Motome \u2013 formerly of the same clan as Hanshir\u014d.\nSaito scornfully recalls the practice of ronin requesting the chance to commit seppuku on the clan's land, hoping to be turned away and given alms.\nMotome arrived at the palace a few months earlier and made the same request as Hanshir\u014d.\nInfuriated by the rising number of \"suicide bluffs\", the three most senior samurai of the clan\u2014Yazaki Hayato, Kawabe Umenosuke, and Omodaka Hikokuro\u2014persuaded Sait\u014d to force Motome to follow through and kill himself.\nUpon examining Motome's swords, their blades were found to be made of bamboo.\nEnraged that any samurai would \"pawn his soul\", the House of Ii forced Motome to disembowel himself with his own bamboo blade, making his death slow, agonizingly painful, and deeply humiliating.\nDespite this warning, Hanshir\u014d insists that he has never heard of Motome and says that he has no intention of leaving the Ii palace alive.\nAfter a suicide pavilion is set up in the courtyard of the palace, Hanshir\u014d is asked to name the samurai who shall behead him when the ritual is complete.\nTo the shock of Sait\u014d and the Ii retainers, Hanshir\u014d successively names Hayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuro\u2014the three samurai who coerced the suicide of Motome.\nWhen messengers are dispatched to summon them, all three decline to come, saying they are suffering from a life-threatening illness.\nAfter provoking their laughter by calling bushido a facade, Hanshir\u014d recounts his story to Sait\u014d and the Ii retainers.\nHe did, he admits, know Motome after all.\nIn 1619, his clan was abolished by the Shogun.\nHis Lord decided to commit seppuku and, as his most senior samurai, Hanshir\u014d planned to die alongside him.\nTo prevent this, Hanshir\u014d's closest friend performed seppuku and left a letter assigning to Hanshir\u014d the guardianship of his teenage son\u2014Motome.\nDespite Hanshir\u014d's pleas, his Lord forbade him to kill himself.\nIn order to support Motome and his own daughter Miho, Hanshir\u014d rented a hovel in the slums of Edo and worked numerous menial jobs.\nDespite this, he retained a firm sense of personal and familial honor.\nRealizing the love between Motome and Miho, Hanshir\u014d arranged for them to marry.\nSoon after, they had a son, Kingo.\nWhen Miho fell ill with a fever, Motome could not bear the thought of losing her and did everything to raise money to hire a doctor.\nWhen Kingo also fell ill, Hanshir\u014d was enraged when Motome claimed to have already sold everything of value.\nMotome, however, calmly explained that there was another way to raise money and that he would return very soon.\nFor hours, Hanshir\u014d and Miho anxiously awaited his return.\nLate that evening, Hayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuro, had brought Motome's mutilated body home.\nThey explained how Motome had come to the Ii palace and had been forced to kill himself.\nThey then displayed his bamboo blades in order to mock their victim before his family.\nAfter they left, Miho spent hours weeping inconsolably over her husband's body.\nThen, she returned to her sickbed next to Kingo.\nHaving had no idea that Motome had sold even his sword blades to save Miho, a devastated Hanshir\u014d implored his son-in-law's forgiveness for his own carelessness.\nSoon after, Kingo died from his illness.\nHaving already lost the will to live, Miho followed after him the next day.\nCompleting his story, Hanshir\u014d explains that his sole desire is to join Motome, Miho, and Kingo in the next world.\nHe explains, however, that they have every right to ask whether justice has been exacted for their deaths.\nTherefore, Hanshiro asks Saito if he has any statement of regret to convey to Motome, Miho, and Kingo.\nHe explains that, if Saito does so, he will die without saying another word.\nSait\u014d, however, insists that Motome was \"a despicable extortioner\" who got exactly what he deserved.\nHe boasts that all other suicide bluffs who come to the Ii palace shall be treated in the same fashion.\nHanshir\u014d then reveals the last part of his story.\nBefore coming to the Ii house, he had tracked down Hayato and Umenosuke, easily defeated them, and cut off their topknots.\nHikokuro then came to Hanshir\u014d's hovel and, with great respect, challenged him to a duel.\nAfter a brief but tense sword fight, Hikokuro suffers a double disgrace: his sword is broken and his topknot was taken as well.\nAs proof of his story, Hanshiro removes their labelled topknots from his kimono and casts them upon the palace courtyard.\nWith deep contempt, Hanshiro reminds everyone that, for a samurai to lose his topknot is a disgrace so horrendous that even suicide can barely atone for it.\nAnd yet, the most revered samurai of the House of Ii \u2014Hayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuro\u2014 lack the fortitude to commit the suicide they would demand from anyone else.\nInstead, they are concealing their dishonor, feigning illness, and waiting for their hair to grow back.\nHanshiro concludes that, despite the Ii clan's pride in its martial history, it seems that the Code of the Samurai is a facade even for them.\nHaving now lost face very badly, an enraged Sait\u014d calls Hanshiro a madman and orders his remaining samurai to kill him.\nIn a battle which rages through the palace, Hanshir\u014d kills four samurai, wounds eight, and contemptuously throws down the antique suit of armor which symbolizes the glorious history of the House of Ii.\nIn a final confirmation of the clan's Machiavellian ways, three Ashigaru arrive armed with matchlock guns\u2014a weapon seen as beneath contempt.\nAs Hanshir\u014d begins seppuku, he is simultaneously shot by all three gunmen.\nTerrified that the Ii clan will be abolished if word gets out that \"a half starved ronin\" killed so many of their retainers, Saito announces that all deaths caused by Hanshiro shall be explained by \"illness\".\nHayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuro are to atone for losing their topknots by committing seppuku.\nSaito angrily orders that a squad of soldiers are to be sent to their houses \"to make sure they do it\".\nAs the suit of armor is lovingly re-erected, the visitor's book of the House of Ii clan is heard in voiceover.\nHanshiro, who was clearly mentally unstable, had to be forced, like Motome before him, to commit suicide.\nThe Shogun, it is said, has issued a personal commendation to the Ii clan for how they handled the suicide bluffs of Motome and Hanshiro.\nAt the end of his letter, the Shogun praises the House of Ii and their samurai as the perfection of the Code of Bushido.\nJanitors clean the grounds where the fighting had occurred, and a janitor finds one of the three severed top knots on the ground.\nHe places it in a bucket.", "title": "Harakiri (1962 film)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q1584406"}}

Norwood and Dorothy view Joe's aircraft vanish off the screen; later Federal Aviation Administration crash investigators tell Norwood that their opinion is his friend's Mustang disintegrated in midair in a manner similar to some accounts of the Mantell UFO incident.\nNorwood finds himself summoned to Washington D.C. where Hank Peters, a member of an influential unnamed agency of the United States Government not only believes his account but shows him a sketch that Norwood identifies as the same craft that buzzed his aircraft.  Peters tells Norwood that the sketch was provided from intelligence sources based in Red China.  Due to Norwood's familiarity with a variety of aircraft, he is asked if he will accompany Peters and two scientists who will be parachuted into Red China.  Peters informs him there are reliable sources that say two humanoids escaped the craft but later died, probably through exposure to the Earth's bacteria. Due to their rapid deterioration, their bodies were cremated.\nAt the drop zone they are met by Chinese American agent Sam Archibald who leads them to the craft that is hidden in the ruins of a Catholic church.  Due to the Communists destroying the church, the local population will assist the Americans in any way possible.  On travelling to their destination and evading units of the People's Liberation Army they come across a party of Russian scientists led by their own version of Agent Peters.

{"id": "tt0479647", "text": "When a body is found hanging on top of the sign demarcating the Ontario-Quebec border, police officers from both Canadian provinces must join forces to solve the murder. David Bouchard (Patrick Huard) is a rule-bending, francophone detective for the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec, while Martin Ward (Colm Feore) is a by-the-book anglophone Ontario Provincial Police detective. The bilingual detectives must resolve their professional and cultural differences as well as their bigotry and prejudices.\nThe body is identified as Benoit Brisset, a hockey executive. The clues lead the pair to Luc Therrien (Sylvain Marcel) at a roadside bar. After a fight in the bar, they imprison him in the trunk of Bouchard's car. Bouchard has promised to watch his daughter's ballet recital, so he drives to the recital and parks the car in front with Therrien still locked in the trunk. When they emerge, they find the car being towed from the no-parking zone, and as they try to chase down the truck driver, the car explodes.\nWith their prime witness dead, they decide to search Therrien's house where they find a large marijuana grow-op in the basement. They also discover another body, a former hockey team owner. A laser tripwire is activated by Bouchard, which sets the house on fire, destroying the house and causing the two cops to get high on the fumes of the burning marijuana. When they are disciplined by Bouchard's police chief shortly afterwards, he angrily removes them from the case after they start laughing hysterically because they're still high.\nThe next victim is discovered in Toronto. They realize that the killer has a pattern of tattooing his victims, with each tattoo providing a clue to the next murder victim. Each murder is in some way connected to major league hockey. (The film uses thinly disguised parodies of National Hockey League teams, owners and players, however, rather than the real league). The pair anticipate the next victim, but he goes missing before they reach him. Ward and Bouchard appear on a hockey broadcast to warn people in the hockey community to be vigilant. The \"Tattoo Killer\" calls in to the show and threatens the two police officers, causing a brawl between them and the anchor (played by Rick Mercer) when they attempt to hang up.\nWard is attacked in his home by a masked assailant whom he discovers is Therrien. Meanwhile, Bouchard has sex with Ward's sister.\nThe \"Tattoo Killer\" kidnaps Bouchard's daughter, leading to the final confrontation with the two policemen. It is ultimately revealed that the murders are being committed by a bilingual portly hockey fan (Luc Therrien), as previously mentioned, under the direction and unequal partnership of a sadistic, psychopathic, sociopathic, fan of the notion of the game of hockey as a Canadian nationalistic symbol that he feels is being permanently corrupted by attempts to move ownership of Canadian teams to venture capitalist groups in the United States.  He is therefore having Therrien commit the murders along with him (with the tattoos as a signature), as revenge against the hockey league for desecrating the game by moving Canadian teams such as the \"Quebec Fleur de Lys\" to the United States. They try to reason with him that hockey is just a game and exchange Therrien who the detectives intercepted tailing them at a conference, for Bouchard's daughter, but this only angers him. The Tattoo Killer executes Therrien, Ward distracts the man while Bouchard unties his daughter.  After a fight, the killer is blown up by one of his own explosives.  During the credits, a news report is shown, revealing that the hockey teams will not be moved.", "title": "Bon Cop, Bad Cop", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q892035"}}

While patrolling in the Philippine Sea, on July 30 in 1945, the unescorted ship is torpedoed and sunk by the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) submarine I-58, taking 300 crewmen with it to the bottom of the Philippine Sea, while the rest climb out of the ship and were left stranded at sea for five days without food and water in shark-infested waters.\nWith no hope for five days, most of the remaining crew-members were eaten by sharks or would die of salt water poisoning by drinking seawater (which also caused some of those injured to die from infectious wounds). Others swam off from their groups after hallucinating of a non-existent island, never to be seen again. On the 5th day, the surviving crew were rescued by an airplane pilot who spotted them by chance and called for a rescue. Only 316 survived the disaster. Looking for a scapegoat for their own gross negligence, the US Navy court-martials and convicts Captain McVay for \"hazarding his ship by failing to zigzag\", despite overwhelming evidence supporting McVay (such as even having the former captain of the IJN's I-58 submarine to testify for the trial, which proved McVay to be not at fault). It ends with Captain McVay finally committing suicide years after the tragedy after being harassed and tormented with phone calls and mail from angry and grief-stricken relatives of the deceased crew-members, as well as the media (mostly in the form of newspapers, which placed the blame on him for the ship's sinking). In the movie's postscript they show President Bill Clinton exonerating Captain McVay of all charges on October 30, 2000.\nIn a subplot, Indianapolis crewmember Mike D'Antonio falls in love with his childhood friend Brian \"Bama\" Smithwick (a diver on the ship)'s friend and love interest Clara. D'Antonio purchases an engagement ring before the trip to Tinian to propose to the girl who tells D'Antonio before the trip that she is expecting their first child. During a brawl involving two of the crewmen, D'Antonio loses the ring and one of the crew members, Alvin, steals it. After the ship is destroyed, Smithwick and D'Antonio spend the next few days in the sea with the rest of the crew where D'Antonio succumbs to massive leg injuries received in a shark attack and Smithwick is given the engagement ring by Alvin. Bama proposes to Clara (fianc\u00e9e with D'Antonio) to help her raise her child and she accepts his proposal.\nWhile the credits roll, two Navy sailors recount the sharks in the waters and real rescue footage is shown along with many still shots of lost sailors.", "title": "USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q20637041"}}

There, he meets its owner, Zero Moustafa, who at dinner tells his rags to riches story.\nIn 1932, Zero is the newly hired lobby boy at the prestigious Grand Budapest Hotel.

As the relationship continues, Jake remains unwilling to view the relationship as serious, despite Anna\u2019s hints at her \u2018taking a class\u2019.

While breathing his last, Brakus wrests a last promise from his son Toran: Search for Lazar-Sa so the king's efforts weren't in vain. Toran is found with the corpse of his father, and is kept captive as his murderer. Toran's old mentor Mak, who is the bearer of a magic bow, frees Toran, and together they both start the search for Lazar-Sa while being chased by Gar and his snake people, who are determined to prevent a new alliance of the clans of Malveel under the leadership of the Falcons. To ensure that, Gar kills Sandros and Riis. Drained by their escape and his age, Mak turns over the magic bow to his apprentice, dying when the bow severs his old bond to unite with Toran.\nToran is able to wound Gar at their next confrontation, which gets the attention of the rogue Slant, who henceforth joins Toran. Although Slant initially tries to steal the bow, he starts taking a genuine liking to Toran and aids him with his world wisdom. At the same time, Estra starts her search for Lazar-Sa to kill him and avenge her mother. In the city of Kamal, Toran, Estra and Slant clash with a person claiming to be Lazar-Sa and trying to chase the people out of the area. Toran, Estra and Slant are asked by the city council to end the menace. Because Lazar-Sa is their common target, the three agree and travel to a canyon where the sorcerer is hiding. After their departure, Gar also finds his way to Kamal, where he picks up Toran's trail again.\nIn the canyon, the three meet Lazar-Sa. They realize very quickly that he is just a magical simulacrum controlled by an ex-slave from Kamal named Rega. He once met Lazar-Sa and got a magical stone and a gauntlet from him to take revenge for the humiliations he has suffered. Rega tells the three where Lazar-Sa was seen last, but then kills himself because his scheme is revealed. Gar, who followed Toran, seizes the gauntlet and challenges Toran. During the battle, Toran strikes Lazar-Sa's stone with an arrow, rendering it unstable. The stone's power destroys the canyon, but Toran, Estra and Slant escape.\nFollowing that, Estra parts from her former companions to follow her own path of finding Lazar-Sa. Toran and Slant are on their way back to Kamal when a message from Lazar-Sa reaches them. Lazar-Sa is promising Toran to lead him to his higher purpose if he frees the sorcerer from his current prison: The Endworld. What Toran and Slant don't know is that Gar also survived the catastrophe in the canyon and still hungers for Toran's death.", "title": "The Archer: Fugitive from the Empire", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q1198162"}}

Two decades later, the legendarily inept film's child star unravels the improbable, heartfelt story of an Alabama dentist-turned-cult movie icon and an Italian filmmaker who come to terms with this genuine, internationally revered cinematic failure.::Anonymous\n\nThis documentary is about _Troll 2 (1990)_ (qv), at one time the #1 worst movie on IMDB's list of 100 worse films (at the time of writing, it is #75). Produced and directed by 'Michael Paul Stephenson' (qv) , who as a 12 year old starred in Trolls 2, the film focuses on how a terrible movie became something of a cult hit. The film focuses primarily on dentist 'George Hardy' (qv) who answered a casting call for the film. He never saw the final product until HBO began screening it. By his own admission, he was terrible and cast members think the same of their own performances. The movies director, 'Claudio Fragasso' (qv), seems to think quite highly of the final product.::garykmcd\n\nIn his small hometown of Alexander City, Alabama, 'George Hardy' (qv) is best known as the gregarious local dentist who dresses up as a roller-blading tooth fairy in the town's annual Christmas parade. Until the movie became a cult classic in the mid-2000's and until its then child star 'Michael Paul Stephenson' (qv) decided to make this documentary about its cult phenomenon, George hid from most of the town's residents that he was the adult star close to two decades earlier in _Troll 2 (1990)_ (qv), which is highly regarded as the worst movie ever made and which at one time held the very bottom ranking of eligible movies on IMDb. In all technical respects, the movie is indeed awful, except in the fact that it entertains its followers in its sheer awfulness. Even most who participated in the making of the film know that it is awful - some who remain in the movie industry and still hide their association with it - except perhaps its Italian husband/wife directing/writing team of 'Claudio Fragasso' (qv) and 'Rossella Drudi' (qv), the former who believes he directed a movie that has some emotion and heart. As the movie gains notoriety through special cinema showings worldwide and through fan conventions and other such events, George and others associated with the film gain some renewed recognition, however niche that recognition is. While some of the movie's actors like 'Connie Young' (qv) still try to keep it a distant memory not on their resume while others like 'Margo Prey' (qv) deal with the personal realities of their current life which doesn't include this movie, George relishes in most - but not all - of the regained fame, and contemplates whether he would like it to be more than just the proverbial fifteen minutes within the context of a full-fledged movie career.::Huggo", "title": "Best Worst Movie", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q3639019"}}

Noah is a suspended college student who lives with his divorced mother in New Jersey and can't even keep a job.\nOne day when Noah is returning home from Marisa's house, his mother is about to leave to a party with a friend of hers. His mother then receives a phone call from her friend who informs her that her children's babysitter canceled last minute. Noah then takes over as babysitter so his mother can go to the party.\nWhen Noah arrives at the house, he is introduced to the kids one after another. The oldest son Slater (Max Records) is a kid with a severe anxiety  disorder. The youngest child is their daughter Blithe (Landry Bender) who is obsessed with pop culture and loves to wear makeup. The second oldest son, Rodrigo (Kevin Hernandez), is a pyromaniac who was adopted from El Salvador. As soon as the parents leave, the children start to act obnoxiously (smashing vases, making fart noises, and attempting to grab the TV remote from Noah).\nWhile in the middle of babysitting, Marisa calls Noah and she asks him to bring cocaine for a party that she's at, saying that she'll repay him with sex afterwards. Noah immediately accepts, and he and the children leave to go get the drugs from Marisa's friend. When they finally arrive, Noah meets drug dealer Karl (Sam Rockwell) and his assistant Julio (JB Smoove). As soon as Karl gives the drugs to Noah, Rodrigo bursts in claiming that he has to go to the bathroom. When Noah leaves, he sees that Rodrigo has stolen a baby dinosaur egg filled with cocaine from Karl's house. While attempting to get the egg back from Rodrigo, the egg smashes pouring cocaine all over Noah's face.\nKarl then calls Noah about the stolen eggs, and tells him that if he doesn't bring the egg back or the $10,000 he owes for the egg, he will kill him.\nNot wanting to be a part of this, Slater asks Noah to take the three of them to the party where their parents are. When Noah sees his mother actually having a good time at the party he can't bring himself to interfere and decides to bring the kids with him. Slater then tells Noah that a bunch of girls are texting him asking him to attend a bat mitzvah for Wendy Sapperstein (a girl that goes to his school). He tells Noah that the bat mitzvah is being held at the Grand Prospect Hall. Noah then comes up with the idea that they can steal the money Wendy gets.\nAt the bat mitzvah, Noah manages to only steal $3,000 because he had to leave due to Rodrigo urinating on the floor. When they leave, they find out that Tina (Samira Wiley), who went to high school with Noah, has stolen the car to get revenge on Noah who went to a party at her house, and threw up on her grandmother's ashes due to him being drunk. Noah gives the $3,000 to Karl and also brings $7,000 worth of checks. Karl refuses the checks and gives Noah one more chance at getting the $7,000. He tells Noah to meet him at the party Marisa is at with the money and if he doesn't, he will kill him.\nNoah then goes to his dad (Bruce Altman) for help, but he refuses because he now hates Noah due to him dropping out of college and just being a loser in general. An angry Noah steals his father's car keys and drives to a jewelry store his dad owns. Noah then steals enough jewelry to pay back Karl, but then Rodrigo blows the store up after placing a cherry bomb in the bathroom. Rodrigo then throws a temper tantrum, and tosses Slater's fanny pack containing pills out the window. Noah stops the car so Slater can get the pills. Noah tells Slater that he's not going to find them, and it is then revealed that Slater is homosexual, and the pills were the only thing that kept him \"normal.\" Noah then makes Slater accept the fact that he's gay, and that there is nothing wrong with it.\nThe group then sees their original car drive by them, and they track it down to a club where Noah confronts Tina about stealing the car. Tina finally lets go of her anger towards Noah by punching him in the face. After Noah leaves, they head out to get the money to Karl but Noah gets pulled over by the police, who steal the jewelry and the cocaine that Karl originally gave him. Noah's only plan now is to get Marisa out of the party and escape Karl, but Karl's gang tracks him down and attempts to kill Noah and the kids, although Noah manages to get away. Noah then engages in a car chase with Karl and Julio. They make Karl's car crash by Rodrigo throwing a cherry bomb in their van, but this causes Noah to spin out, and Karl holds him at gunpoint.\nNoah manages to run away and Karl wastes all his ammo on shooting at Noah. Then, Blithe calls Tina's gang, and they beat Karl up so they can escape.\nBefore Noah drops Marisa off at her house, the two break up. Noah then manages to get the kids home on time, and they see that everything that went on that night is on the news. The parents arrive home, and they pay Noah for the night.\nDuring the end credits, what happens to all the main characters is revealed: Noah got a new girlfriend, Slater grew up and got a job at the entertainment industry, Blithe gave up her pop culture obsession and started inventing perfumes as an adult, Rodrigo gave up being a pyromaniac, Karl was hospitalized after being beat up by Tina's gang, and Julio died due to burning to death.", "title": "The Sitter", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q798776"}}

{"id": "tt0098825", "text": "After Margaret Thatcher's resignation, the ruling Conservative Party is about to elect a new leader.  Francis Urquhart (Ian Richardson), a Member of Parliament (MP) and the Government Chief Whip in the House of Commons, introduces viewers to the contestants, from which Henry \"Hal\" Collingridge (David Lyon) emerges victorious. Urquhart is secretly contemptuous of the well-meaning but weak Collingridge, but expects a promotion to a senior position in the Cabinet. After the general election, which the party wins by a reduced majority, Urquhart submits his suggestions for a reshuffle that includes his desired promotion. However, Collingridge \u2013 citing Harold Macmillan's political demise after the 1962 Night of the Long Knives \u2013 effects no changes at all. Urquhart resolves to oust Collingridge, with encouragement from his wife, Elizabeth (Diane Fletcher).\nAt the same time, with Elizabeth's blessing, Urquhart begins an affair with Mattie Storin (Susannah Harker), a junior political reporter at a Conservative-leaning tabloid newspaper called The Chronicle. The affair allows Urquhart to manipulate Mattie and indirectly skew her coverage of the Conservative leadership contest in his favour. Mattie has an apparent Electra complex; she finds appeal in Urquhart's much older age and later refers to him as \"Daddy\". Another unwitting pawn is Roger O'Neill (Miles Anderson), the party's cocaine-addicted public relations consultant.\nUrquhart blackmails O'Neill into leaking information on budget cuts that humiliates Collingridge during the Prime Minister's Questions. Later, he blames party chairman Lord \"Teddy\" Billsborough (Nicholas Selby) for leaking an internal poll showing a drop in Tory numbers, leading Collingridge to sack him. As Collingridge's image suffers, Urquhart encourages ultraconservative Foreign Secretary Patrick Woolton (Malcolm Tierney) and Chronicle owner Benjamin Landless (Kenny Ireland) to support his removal. He also poses as Collingridge's alcoholic brother Charles (James Villiers) to trade shares in a chemical company about to benefit from advance information confidential to the government. Consequently, Collingridge becomes falsely accused of insider trading and is forced to resign.\nIn the ensuing leadership race, Urquhart initially feigns unwillingness to stand before announcing his candidacy. With the help of his underling, Tim Stamper (Colin Jeavons), Urquhart goes about making sure his competitors drop out of the race: Health Secretary Peter MacKenzie (Christopher Owen) accidentally runs his car over a disabled protester at a demonstration staged by Urquhart and is forced by the public outcry to withdraw, while Education Secretary Harold Earle (Kenneth Gilbert) is blackmailed into withdrawing when Urquhart anonymously sends pictures of him in the company of a rent boy whom Earle had paid for sex.\nThe first ballot leaves Urquhart to face Woolton and Michael Samuels, the moderate Environment Secretary supported by Billsborough. Urquhart eliminates Woolton by a prolonged scheme: at the party conference, he pressures O'Neill into persuading his personal assistant and lover, Penny Guy (Alphonsia Emmanuel), to have a one-night stand with Woolton in his suite, which Urquhart records via a bugged ministerial red box. When the tape is sent to Woolton, he is led to assume that Samuels is behind the scheme and backs Urquhart in the contest. Urquhart also receives support from Collingridge, who is unaware of Urquhart's role in his own downfall. Samuels is forced out of the running when the tabloids reveal that he backed leftist causes as a student at University of Cambridge.\nStumbling across contradictions in the allegations against Collingridge and his brother, Mattie begins to dig deeper. On Urquhart's orders, O'Neill arranges for her car and flat to be vandalised in a show of intimidation. However, O'Neill becomes increasingly uneasy with what he is being asked to do, and his cocaine addiction adds to his instability. Urquhart mixes O'Neill's cocaine with rat poison, causing him to kill himself when taking the cocaine in a motorway service station lavatory. Though initially blind to the truth of matters thanks to her relations with Urquhart, Mattie eventually deduces that Urquhart is responsible for O'Neill's death and is behind the unfortunate downfalls of Collingridge and all of Urquhart's rivals.\nMattie looks for Urquhart at the point when it seems his victory is certain. She eventually finds him on the roof garden of the Houses of Parliament, where she confronts him. He admits to O'Neill's murder and everything else he has done. He then asks whether he can trust Mattie, and, though she answers in the affirmative, he does not believe her and throws her off the roof onto a van parked below. An unseen person picks up Mattie's tape recorder, which she had been using to secretly record her conversations with Urquhart.

informed by the archive clerk &ndash; seizes the document from her.\nMakepeace's leadership challenge has attracted enough support to convince Urquhart that his position is in jeopardy.\nHe decides to leak information regarding the oil deposits in order to stir up a conflict in Cyprus as \"our Falklands\" to unite Britain under his leadership.\nWhen Greek nationalists kidnap a British diplomat and the Greek Cypriot President, Urquhart deploys British troops to retrieve them.\nThough the troops successfully rescue the hostages, the intervention later results in the death of civilians, including young schoolgirls, largely because of the prime minister's drastic orders.\nUrquhart's support plummets, and when he proves unwilling to accept responsibility for the deaths or express sympathy for the victims, many MPs openly call on him to resign.\nWhile Urquhart appears defiant, his wife is worried, and she consults Corder for advice on how to save him.\nCorder advises \"drastic measures\", and informs her that he has sent a copy of Mattie Storin's tape, revealing Urquhart's role in her death, to Makepeace.\nMakepeace confronts the prime minister and announces that he will publish the tape, but not before Urquhart has achieved his aim of surpassing Margaret Thatcher's record.\nAfter this, Urquhart again meets Maria.\nThe incriminating Cyprus report has been sent to Maria's father anonymously - presumably by Corder - and Maria vows to publish it.\nAfter this, Urquhart despairs, but Elizabeth consoles him: \"We can be safe still.\n\" and hints at a ploy by Corder.\nAt the unveiling of the Margaret Thatcher memorial, on the day when Urquhart surpasses her record, a sniper in Corder's services appears on a rooftop and shoots the prime minister (and Maria's father, who had approached Urquhart with a pistol).\nElizabeth had arranged for his assassination as the only way to preserve his reputation (and the retirement fund).\nUrquhart dies in her arms, while Corder offers his services to Makepeace, the apparent successor.", "title": "The Final Cut (TV serial)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q7733901"}}

At least one chiropteran has managed to infiltrate the air base, and it is only a matter of time before they feed again, go into hibernation, and become untraceable. Saya is to pose as a school girl, infiltrate the high school adjacent to the base, and then track and kill the chiropterans.\nAt the school, Saya runs into a meek nurse, Amino Makiho, on the eve of the school's annual Halloween party. Two of Saya's classmates, Sharon and Linda, make a visit to Makiho at the nurse's office. Suddenly, Saya bursts into the room, killing Linda and wounding Sharon, breaking her sword in the process. Both girls are revealed to be chiropterans. Makiho goes into shock at the revelation. Meanwhile, a third chiropteran reveals itself and begins making its way to the base. Back at the school, Makiho regains her nerve and pursues Sharon into a room full of dancing Americans in costume, where she finds Sharon transformed. Saya saves her and both flee into a nearby motor pool. The chiropterans trap them inside and attack.\nDavid delivers a new sword, and Saya uses it to kill Sharon. The final chiropteran then decides to flee, attempting to stow away on a departing cargo plane. David and Saya give chase and she manages to strike the chiropteran and mortally wound it. She then stands over the dying creature and lets some of her blood trickles into its mouth. Louis arrives and recovers Makiho before the local police reach her.\nAfterward, Makiho is seen in an interview with government officials who question her about the night's events. However, it's revealed that all evidence of the battle between Saya and the chiropterans has been covered up and both David and Saya have disappeared, leaving Makiho with nothing to prove the veracity of her story. Her interviewer then asks her to identify Saya in a picture which has a girl that looks identical to her, except the picture was taken in 1892. The only other description of the picture is the word \"VAMPIRE\".

Concerned about his daughter's health and the welfare of his family, as well as despising his job, Skip grows tired of the city life and decides to move his family to the Rocky Mountains with no plans to ever return due to the smog and congestion. After moving his wife Pat and two children, eleven-year-old Jennifer and seven-year-old Toby to the wilderness and then building their own cabin near a large lake, they settle in to find out that their new environment isn't always as peaceful as it may appear.\nFrom the start, the Robinson family seemed to be adjusting to their new life in the Colorado wilderness. A few days after finishing building their new cabin, Toby and Skip go out hunting one morning with their dog Kress, and succeed in catching a grouse for the family dinner. Later that day, while climbing along the rocky slopes of a large hill, Skip and his son almost get caught in a deadly landslide. They later find a pair of young grizzly bear cubs who have lost their mother to the same landslide they got caught in. The cubs are quickly adopted into the Robinson family, but Pat and Skip tell their children that sooner or later the cubs would have to be released back into the wild when they are fully grown.\nDuring the next few weeks, the Robinson family slowly adapt to their new life in the mountains. In addition to the two young bear cubs and their family dog, Skip and his family also befriend a raccoon that they find living near their cabin and name him Bandito. While Jenny and Toby are collecting flowers, they encounter cougar cubs near their den. The family receive numerous letters and packages from friends and family back in Los Angeles. Pat receives several letters from her mother and Jenny and Toby are given numerous schoolbooks from the Los Angeles schoolboard. Skip continues hunting for small game and fishing in the nearest creek to provide food for his family, while his wife works around the house and their two children work on their schoolwork.\nOne day, while fishing for some trout down by the creek with the two grizzly cubs, Skip and the cubs are scared by a large black bear that was roaming along the creekbed. Jenny and Toby had gone out for a walk with their dog Kress, to which they later encounter the same bear that their dad saw down by the creek. While Toby heads back to the cabin to get his parents, Jenny goes after Kress, who has managed to scare the bear away. Skip is informed by Toby of what happened, and he heads out with his rifle to find his daughter.\nWhile trying to find their way back to the cabin, Jenny and Kress are attacked by a pack of gray wolves who chase them down to a nearby lake and almost attack Jenny. Kress is able to fend the wolves off long enough for Skip to arrive in the nick of time and drive the pack away. Despite this frightening encounter, Jenny quickly recovers from the shock of what had happened and is brought home safe and sound.\nThe next day, Skip and his family meet a friendly aging mountain man who introduces himself as Boomer. Boomer informs them that he had been a longtime partner and friend to Ol' Jake, Skip's uncle who lived in the same area where the Robinsons had built their cabin. Ol' Jake had been known to take extremely good care of the local wildlife in the area, including a friendly black bear named Samson he raised from a cub to a massive adult that was the same black bear that Skip and his family had encountered a few times before. Boomer also warns Skip and his family to keep a watchful eye for Three-Toes, a locally notorious grizzly bear that has been known to invade the properties of humans who are living in the mountains. Boomer is then forced to leave when the two bear cubs accidentally frighten away Boomer's mule Flora.\nLater on, while the family was out gathering a large bear walks into their cabin. Seeing it's a black bear, the children decide it must be Samson. Taking a risk, Skip follows Boomer's advice and \"introduces himself\". Thankfully it pays off and the bear, who turns out to be Samson, befriends the family and joins them for dinner. The family settles in further to their new life, gathering from the surrounding forests and spending time with their new animal friends and Boomer.\nOne day, while Pat and Jenny are picking berries, they encounter Three-Toes; Kress manages to fend off Three-Toes while Pat retrieves Jenny, who suffered a massive shock. Skip goes to find Kress while tracking down Three-Toes. The following morning, Jenny's condition has gotten worse, Skip tries to call for help but the radio's batteries are dead, so he has to walk to get help. During a windstorm, Three-Toes tries to break into the cabin, but Pat tries to fend him off. Samson comes to the family's defence and engages Three-Toes in a brawl as Pat reloads the gun. Samson manages to hold the grizzly off long enough and Pat manages to shoot Three-Toes, killing him. Skip returns with a doctor, saying that Jenny's health is improving. Pat is still hesitant about staying but she agrees to adapt as this is a better life for her and her family.

Liang, a city-state on the Zhao\u2013Yan border, is in peril of being conquered by the Zhao army. Ge Li, a Mohist, comes to Liang to help defend the city. Although the King of Liang has already planned for peace talks with the invaders, Ge Li manages to convince him and the people of Liang to put up resistance by warning them of the consequences of surrendering. He also promises the King that the invaders will give up on Liang if they fail to conquer it within a month, because their main target is actually the Yan state. The King has doubts about Ge Li's idea but still puts Ge in command of his army.\nGe Li creates a bulwark and various traps to halt the Zhao army's advance. When he insists that Zituan lead the archers, Liang Shi (the Liang prince) is angered because he sees Zituan's archery skill as inferior to his. Even though Zituan later proves to be a better archer, Ge Li's style of working puts him at odds with Liang Shi and the other Liang generals. Ge Li also briefly meets Xiang Yanzhong, the commander-in-chief of the Zhao army, for a board game outside the city to understand each other better. During the first Zhao attack, Ge Li's defence tactics worked well\u2014a Zhao general was killed and the invaders were forced to retreat\u2014but the Liang forces also suffered losses from a skirmish with Zhao infiltrators inside the city. Ge Li's success earns him the support of the people and he becomes a highly revered hero. Yiyue, a female cavalry commander, falls in love with Ge Li. However, Ge Li is reluctant to accept her feelings for him and tries to draw boundaries between them. One night, Ge Li and Yiyue scout the Zhao camp and discover that the enemy is digging tunnels to bypass their city's defences. Ge Li used that to his advantage by luring the Zhao soldiers into an ambush and then sealing the tunnel exits. The Liang general Niu Zizhang massacres the captured Zhao soldiers even though they were promised that their lives would be spared if they laid down their weapons.\nIn the meantime, the King feels threatened when he sees Ge Li's growing popularity, so he plots to have Ge stripped off his post and executed on false charges. At the same time, the Liang forces receive news that the Zhao army has retreated. Ge Li plans to leave Liang since his mission is complete. He goes out to check that the Zhao army is indeed retreating. When he returns, he is stopped outside the gates and is accused of starting a war under false pretences and plotting to seize the throne. Just as the Liang soldiers are about to kill Ge Li, Liang Shi shows up, pretends to fight with Ge, and secretly tells Ge to take him hostage in order to buy time for Ge to escape. Ge Li manages to escape but Liang Shi is killed by a rain of arrows meant for Ge Li. Meanwhile, Ge Li's supporters, including Yiyue, are falsely accused of plotting a rebellion against the King and are arrested and tortured. Yiyue denounces the King and is sentenced to death. The King also has her rendered mute to prevent her from speaking up against him. Zituan refuses to turn against Ge Li, so he cuts off his right arm and leaves the Liang army.\nOne night, just as Yiyue is about to be executed, the Zhao army launches a surprise attack and completely catches the Liang defenders off guard. She is taken back to the prison. Instead of focusing on fighting the invaders, the King orders his soldiers to kill those who try to escape from the city. Liang eventually falls to the Zhao army, and the King and his people are captured. Zituan and his archers manage to escape from Liang, and they join Ge Li outside the city. Xiang Yanzhong sends a message to Ge Li, in which he threatens to kill the people of Liang if Ge does not return to Liang to meet him. Ge Li returns to Liang alone and agrees to play the board game again with Xiang Yanzhong inside a tower. They agree that only the winner can leave the tower. Meanwhile, Zituan and his men flood the areas guarded by Zhao forces and launch an attack. Seeing that reinforcements have arrived, the people of Liang rise up against the Zhao invaders and succeed in defeating them and driving them out of the city. Xiang Yanzhong refuses to leave the tower because he feels that he has lost. After the battle, the King passes by the tower, sees Xiang Yanzhong, and orders Xiang to be killed. While the people of Liang rejoice in their victory, Ge Li rushes to the flooded prison to find Yiyue but arrives too late because she was unable to call out to him for help and has already drowned.\nBefore the film ends, Ge Li leaves with some orphans to promote peace among the various warring states.

As an American girl named Nina Martin (Nathalia Ramos) moves into Anubis House, another resident, Joy Mercer (Klariza Clayton), suddenly disappears and vanishes without a trace. Nina takes her place and the school staff eliminates all traces of Joy's existence. Joy's best friend, Patricia Williamson (Jade Ramsey), is dismayed to learn this and accuses Nina of being involved with her disappearance. Forced to spend a night in the attic, Nina makes a bizarre discovery: the recorded diary of a young girl whom she met earlier as an old woman, Sarah Frobisher-Smythe (Rita Davies), who had lived in the house long ago. On the tapes, it is revealed the house has a secret history, a mystery that nobody knows anything about. Sarah has given Nina an Eye of Horus-shaped necklace with mysterious powers revealed to Nina when she decides to investigate the house's mystery, alongside her new friend Fabian Rutter (Brad Kavanagh) and new roommate Amber Millington (Ana Mulvoy Ten). They form a secret group called \"Sibuna\" (Anubis backwards) whose popularity expands to include Patricia, once she makes peace with Nina after learning that Joy's disappearance is connected to the house, and Alfie Lewis (Alex Sawyer), another classmate and prankster. Eventually, Jerome Clarke (Eugene Simon) joins in the mystery as well. Mara Jaffray (Tasie Lawrence), Mick Campbell (Bobby Lockwood), and Trudy Rehmann (Mina Anwar), the house mother, are oblivious to the mystery. Sibuna collects all seven puzzle pieces hidden within the house and discovers that the pieces put together make the Cup of Ankh. However, this can only be performed by the chosen one. Everyone believes that Joy is indeed the chosen one as she was born on the seventh of July at seven o' clock. However, they discover that the chosen one was born at seven AM, which was when Nina was born and makes her the chosen one instead of Joy, who was born at seven PM. Nina must make the cup before Victor and the teachers or Rufus Zeno get their hands on it.\nIn the second season, Senkhara (the forgotten ruler, a dead spirit) from ancient Egypt curses Nina with the Mark of Anubis \u2013 with the instructions that she must find the Mask of Anubis or she will die. Along their journey, Sibuna discover a chamber of tunnels underneath the house that contain a series of puzzling and dangerous tasks to unlock new parts of the tunnels and lead to the mask. However, Senkhara isn't happy with how long it is taking Nina. As a warning, she punishes Alfie, Amber, Fabian and Patricia with the Mark of Anubis also. Alongside the group, Victor is also searching for the mask as he believes that it holds the missing ingredient for the elixir of life \u2013 tears of gold. To obtain the Book of Isis that contains the recipe for the elixir, Victor instructs Mr Sweet to gain an Egyptian Exhibition. Jerome locates his father in prison, who tells him that in order to reverse his bad luck, Jerome must find the Frobisher Gem and put it into the Frobisher shield after he stole it as a child. New American pupil Eddie (Burkely Duffield) becomes rivals with Patricia, even though they are just hiding the fact that they are attracted to each other. Victor teams up with Anubis House's new housemother, Vera, who 'helps' him with locating the mask. Unbeknown to Victor, Vera is in fact working with Rufus Zeno. It is a race against each other as Sibuna and Victor try to outwit one another on the quest for the Mask of Anubis that will lead to eternal life. In the end, Nina leaves for good to live with her grandmother.\nIn the third season, a new teacher, Miss Denby (Susy Kane), comes to the school and seems to hang out with Victor and Mr. Sweet often. New American student K.T. Rush (Alexandra Shipp) comes to the school. Eddie has a vision of K.T.'s dying grandfather giving her a key and telling her to go to Anubis House. Eddie and K.T. do some snooping around the house while Fabian tries to decipher a series of codes mistakenly given to Amber. Eddie, K.T. and Willow become new members of Sibuna. When Amber leaves for fashion school, Sibuna is revived with Eddie as a leader and Fabian, K.T., Patricia and Alfie and Willow as members. They find out that the adults are trying to reawaken a sleeping Robert Frobisher-Smythe, with Denby being the \"Keeper\" [she keeps Frobisher in the tank room in the gatehouse (her home on the school property)], Victor being the \"Enabler\", and Mr. Sweet being the \"Seeker\". The Sibunas discover that Miss Harriet Denby's name is actually Caroline. Her sister is actually Harriet \u2013 and the original Keeper. However, she is locked in a mental hospital because of her sister. It turns out that K.T. is the great-granddaughter of Frobisher. Jerome, Joy, Alfie, and Patricia are the descendants of Frobisher's friends and are needed for the ceremony, but because of Caroline Denby lying about her identity, Frobisher is reawakened evil.\nEverybody thinks that the ceremony didn't work out since Sibuna intervened just in time, but when Caroline goes to the gatehouse to pack her bags, she meets Frobisher, who is reawakened and evil. Caroline does not tell Eric Sweet or Victor about this. Robert explains to Caroline that he needs to capture five sinning people for Ammut at midnight or noon, so that they could become evil. The sinners captured are Victor, Patricia, Mr. Sweet, Fabian and Alfie. Ammut rises, but needs more souls. She gives Frobisher a book that easily captures people's souls. A fake assembly is organized as an attempt to capture more souls. Willow (Louisa Connolly-Burnham) is the only person who didn't become a sinner. Willow, Eddie and K.T. are chased by Frobisher and the soul-less students but Harriet comes to the rescue with a stolen ambulance. She explains that Willow didn't become a sinner because she had K.T.'s moon key, and that Ammut can be sent back with Caroline's sun key and K.T.'s moon key. Willow becomes a sinner when she and K.T. try to steal the sun key because Harriet slipped the moon key into K.T.'s pocket. In the end, Ammut is sent back, devouring Caroline. Frobisher is not evil again and old. All the sinners are back to normal and don't remember what happened during the time they were sinners. Willow doesn't even remember the short time that she was good, so she forgot about the whole mystery. The Sibunas, of course, are told by Eddie and K.T. about what happened. Frobisher and Harriet set off for Egypt, and Jerome and Joy finally get together after a lot of drama, involving Jerome cheating on Mara and Willow. Mara and Fabian flirt. The group enjoys a fireworks display.\nIn the finale special Touchstone of Ra, the Anubis House residents are preparing for their graduation; however, their joyous celebration plans are cut short with the arrival of four [freshmen] fourth years who move in early \u2013 Cassie, Erin, Dexter and Sophia. Patricia instantly antagonizes Sophia because she spotted her flirting with Eddie. On their trip to an Egyptian museum, Eddie, Dexter and Sophia discover a special artifact known as the Touchstone of Ra. Back at the house, Victor announces that an artifact from the museum was stolen, and the Touchstone suddenly appears to be in Eddie's possession. Victor confiscates the Touchstone but has no intentions of returning it. Later, the Sibunas (along with Sophia and Mara) overhear Victor speaking to Mr. Sweet about what happens when the Pyramid of Ra is built. They plan to prevent him from building the Pyramid, retrieving the Touchstone for good measure. Eventually, Eddie discovers that Sophia has betrayed them when she plans to complete the Pyramid of Ra herself. At the graduation ceremony, Mara is manipulated by an unknown force when she wears the valedictorian medal (which is actually an artifact discovered by Alfie). At the house, the Sibunas team up with Victor to find the remaining pillars of the Pyramid to stop Sophia from accomplishing her goal. In the final showdown, the Pyramid is incomplete and the students are saved. Since Sophia fails, she is transformed into stone as a punishment from Ra. Eddie loses his Osirian powers in the process. Since Victor's \"destiny\" was to prevent the pyramid from ever being built, he decides to leave the house for good that evening as the students celebrate their graduation party.", "title": "House of Anubis", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q772923"}}

After Milo's proposal to search for the Journal is rejected by the museum board, a mysterious woman, Helga Sinclair, introduces Milo to Preston B. Whitmore, an eccentric millionaire. Whitmore has already funded a successful effort to retrieve the Journal as repayment of a debt to Milo's late grandfather, and recruits Milo to decipher the journal and join an expedition to Atlantis.\nThe expedition is headed by Commander Rourke, who also led the Journal recovery expedition. The crew includes Helga; Vinny, a demolitions expert; Moli\u00e8re, a geologist; Dr. Sweet, a medical officer; Audrey, a mechanic; Mrs. Packard, a radio operator; Cookie, a mess cook; and several trained soldiers. They set out in the massive submarine \"Ulysses\", but are attacked by a mechanical leviathan that guards Atlantis' entrance. The \"Ulysses\" is destroyed, leaving only a handful of survivors. Following the Journal's instructions, they enter a cavern and travel through a dormant volcano, where they are met by Kida, miraculously still alive and young. She and the other Atlanteans have forgotten their written language, and the society has languished, but they can understand English due to spoken Atlantean being the basis for many modern languages. \nAgainst her father's wishes, Kida enlists Milo to help Atlantis regain its old glory, and leads him to an underwater mural in the sunken part of the city. Milo learns from the mural that \"The Heart of Atlantis\" provides the people there with longevity, and once powered their devices, via smaller crystals they all wear. He discovers a page of the Journal, which also contained this information, is missing. Returning to the surface, he is confronted by Rourke, who reveals he has the missing page. He and the crew capture Milo and Kida, and Rourke mortally wounds the King of Atlantis demanding to know where the Heart is. However, he eventually finds it for himself beneath the palace. The giant crystal, sensing a threat, merges with Kida, and Rourke puts her in a crate, intending to sell her at the surface.\nMilo reveals to his friends that the Atlanteans will die if the Heart is removed, and most of them find their consciences will not let them help Rourke. Rourke, Helga, and the soldiers leave the rest behind and start for the surface. The dying King gives Milo his own crystal, and explains he once attempted to create weapons from the Heart, causing the past explosion and the death of his wife. He also explains the crystal must have a royal host when the city is in danger, and begs Milo to save Atlantis. \nMilo and his friends rally the Atlanteans to reactivate their machinery, and pursue and attack the mercenaries. Rourke and Helga have a falling-out during the battle, and he throws her into the dormant volcano. As she dies, she shoots the airship containing Kida's crate.

All of Dorothy's friends become trapped in the situations they were in when she first met them, meaning they all must visit the Wizard as they did in the pilot for the TV series. Dorothy receives a letter from the Scarecrow, called Socrates in the special, as in the series, telling her that everyone is happy with the gifts the Wizard gave them, and that they miss her very much. She goes to find her magic Silver Shoes and is instantly taken back to Oz again by another Kansas twister, this time not by house, but an apple tree. Once she arrives there she is greeted by the Munchkins in Munchkinville.  Glinda arrives to tell her that the previously melted Wicked Witch of the West has become reconstituted and is wreaking havoc again, having taken Socrates' diploma and burned it, destroyed the heart of the Tin Woodman, called Rusty, by turning herself into a Tin Woman, and dropping him into a pond where he rusted over again. She has also stolen the medal that belonged to the Cowardly Lion, called Dandy, and turned it into a daisy, and is planning to get Dorothy's silver shoes again.\nDorothy sets off to find her friends, without knowing the Wicked Witch is watching them in her Crystal Ball. She finds and oils Rusty who has rusted after the Witch tricked him. They find Socrates in a corn field on a pole scaring crows again and get him down. They find Dandy crying, and after some unexpectedly cruel bullying from Socrates and Rusty, they cheer him up.  After the four friends are reunited, they arrive at the Emerald City, only to be tricked by the Witch, who has captured the Wizard and taken over as the ruler of Oz. The Wizard, who in this continuity is not an Omaha huckster but an Ozite born and bred and the elected ruler of Oz, tells them to destroy her again and he will give them what they want. She arrives back at her castle just before Dorothy and her friends, but before they arrive she sends flying alligators to kill them. Socrates' quick thinking saves them as they hide under his straw (a method employed in more than one of the Oz books). Rusty saves them from a lightning bolt by sacrificing himself, which kills him, despite his being made of tin. Dorothy asks Glinda if she will help and a glowing ball brings him back to life. They arrive and are trapped by the Witch. She grabs Dorothy and tries to take her silver slippers. The gang (including the Wizard himself) try to get her back from the Witch, who gives her and Dandy the slippers. Dorothy, who is being held upside-down from the window, tells Dandy that he will turn to stone if he takes them, but he takes them anyway without being turned to stone. The Witch takes them only to be turned into stone, crumble, and fall apart. The gang returns to the Emerald City, only to find out that the Wizard is, after all, a humbug, unable as he always was to return Dorothy home. Glinda appears to tell Dorothy the reason that her friends didn't turn to stone was because they had brains, a heart, and courage. She also explains that the Witch was cruel and heartless, brainless enough to think evil could conquer good and cowardly in that she used slaves and suppressed others. Dorothy wishes to go back, and instantly a Kansas twister whisks her and Toto back home to Aunt Em and Uncle Henry again.", "title": "Return to Oz (TV special)", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q7317317"}}

{"id": "tt0108311", "text": "Peter Derns (Timothy Hutton) is an executive for a cookie company.\nHe has just been released from a clinic after being treated for paranoia and he is still in a shaky emotional state.\nOn his first day back at work, he becomes further upset when he walks into a marketing meeting to make a new product presentation without knowing that his company has been taken over by a major food conglomerate.\nThe company's new owners are looking to make cutbacks and Peter's whole career is riding on his new-product introduction.\nPeter's ruthless boss and supervisor, Charlene (Faye Dunaway), whose job is also at risk, wants a complete report by Peter on her desk no later than noon on the following day.\nWhen Peter's male personal assistant, Lance, takes off, he frets that he will never make the deadline.\nBut to Peter's good fortune, the company assigns him a temp worker, the brunette, seductive-looking Kris Bolin (Lara Flynn Boyle).\nKris soon proves herself to Peter by solving two marketing problems with Peter's new product in short order over the next few days.\nPeter and Kris soon bond over their lunch breaks where Kris tells Peter about herself: she has an office-skills degree from Stanford and has a husband and young daughter.\nKris, being ruthlessly efficient, brilliant and unflaggingly loyal to Peter, hopes to use her skills to become his permanent secretary.\nDespite Kris's possessive attitude, Peter cannot seem to do without her, nor can the rest of the office.\nNot only does Kris help him deliver his report to Charlene on time, she passes on credit to him for her own ideas.\nHowever, soon various people around the office meet with unfortunate \"accidents,\" beginning when Peter's assistant, Lance, returns the following week and, while attempting to fix a paper shredder during his first day back, is maimed when his right hand gets stuck and mutilated, forcing him to take permanent leave.\nPeter starts to note the deaths of some of his rivals for advancement in the company, such as Hartsell (Oliver Platt), who is found dead in his stalled car on a busy expressway after being stung by a wasp.\nAnother few days later, Jasser (Dwight Schultz) is found in his office after hanging himself in an apparent suicide.\nPeter becomes to suspect that Kris is responsible for these deaths, but he cannot prove it or get anyone to listen to him due to his recovering mental state.\nNevertheless, the deaths of the executives lay the groundwork for Peter's own unearned promotions.\nMeanwhile, Peter is determined to win back his estranged wife (Maura Tierney), and begins to spurn all of Kris's advances towards him.\nPeter, starting to distrust Kris, refuses her advances for a romantic relationship, as well as a professional partnership, and even just a simple friendship.\nSoon things for Peter begin to go wrong.\nA marketing test for Peter's new cookie product is horribly sabotaged when broken glass is added to the batter of the cookies, injuring random people who test the new product out.\nPeter becomes more convinced that Kris is behind the mayhem, but he still cannot get anyone to listen to him because everyone around him writes off his claims as more paranoia.\nSoon, Peter's paranoia begins to work against him as he starts to suspect an old friend (Steven Weber), at a rival cookie company, of being behind the events.\nPeter also begins to suspect Charlene herself is trying to destroy his career to protect her own.\nPeter begins looking into Kris's past and learns that at her last temp job at a local bank, her boss, whom she may have had an affair with, died mysteriously.\nPeter also learns that Kris never went to Stanford, nor does she have any husband or child.\nPeter confronts Kris about what she may be doing behind the scenes, but she naturally denies doing anything wrong.\nThe very next day, Peter is shunned from his job after someone frames him for leaking company information to a rival company.\nHowever, Kris comes to his aid by accepting responsibility for the \"computer error\", which earns Peter's promotion to vice president and Kris's promotion to marketing executive.\nBy the climax of the film, Peter and Kris are sent to the company's bakery on a weekend retreat, where the car in which they are both riding nearly runs off the road after someone tampers with the brakes.\nAfter checking into their hotel for the night (in separate rooms), Peter gets a message from Charlene about an emergency at the company's bakery.\nUpon going there, he finds a dead security guard, killed by a letter opener knife that Kris had earlier given him.\nKris he finds is also present at the bakery, but appears to be suffering from a mild concussion due to a supposed blow to her head.\nHe enters the bakery grounds office and attempts to call for an ambulance, but someone hits him from behind and tries to finish him off, only for someone else to tackle his attacker.\nIn his disoriented state, Peter wanders out of the office to see Kris struggling with Charlene in a brutal fight along a catwalk.\nYet it is nearly impossible to tell from Peter's point-of-view if Kris is trying to kill Charlene, or if Charlene is trying to kill Kris.\nPeter intervenes in the fight and Charlene falls from a plank and is left hanging from a railing.\nHe attempts to pull her up but she slips from his grasp and falls to her death, but not before saying \"The picture\".\nMonths later, Peter works on rebuilding his relationship with his family, and is made president of the company and privately thanks Kris for saving his life.\nHowever, as he settles into Charlene's office, he glances at an open box containing some of her stuff that is still being cleared out, and spots four exact photos of Kris's husband and child together, each in exactly the same frame that she uses.\nAfter Charlene's secretary explains that they were a cheap gift from her to Charlene, and that the photos just came with the frames, Peter suddenly realizes what Charlene meant by her last words.\nPeter theorizes that Charlene did indeed look into his earlier claim that Kris had lied about her educational background and had not only found them to be true, but discovered also that Kris' husband and child was also a lie, having no doubt seen the photo she used.\nKnowing she would be fired, Kris orchestrated the incident at the bakery with the intent to kill Charlene, and possibly Peter as well.\nPeter confronts Kris with this revelation, but she yet again denies everything and states that the photo is a means for single office women like her to discourage male co-workers from hitting on them.\n(Note: throughout the entire film, whenever Kris is caught in a lie about her past or work, she makes up a whole new lie on the spur of the moment to replace or patch up the old lie).\nPeter, however, refuses to believe her anymore.\nFinally aware that Kris is a master manipulator and sociopath, but also aware that he will never be able to prove that Kris was responsible for all the deaths and incidents at the company nor will she ever admit to any wrongdoing, Peter decides to remove Kris the old fashioned way: he then contacts the front desk and instructs security to detain Kris and to call for the police.\nThe film ends with Peter's final line: \"Clean out your desk, Kris.\nYou're fired\".\nEspecially, since Peter had risen into becoming the president of the company, he gained the power to be able to terminate Kris' employment.", "title": "The Temp (film)",

Outside of the building, an Israeli Mossad team attempts to rig a bomb under the Doctor's car. The operation fails and one of the team is killed. \nThe next scene takes place on the Cayman Islands where Holland (Charles Bronson), a retired assassin, lives in relative peace. He is asked by an old friend to assassinate the Doctor. Though he initially refuses to intervene, after learning that his friend Jorge was killed by him and watching videoed testimonies of Molloch's other tortured victims from around the world, including Chile and Asia, Holland then decides to avenge his friend.  He agrees to search for Molloch but wants to appear as a family man/tourist and therefore accompanies Jorge's widow Rhiana and her daughter Sarah into Guatemala, where the Doctor is based.\nThe three meet up with Max Ortiz, a friend, who takes them to a cock fighting ring frequented by Molloch.  They are followed by an apparently crippled man, but Holland alerts him to his presence before he can get to him and he escapes.  Later, Max shows them to Molloch's compound.  Holland returns at night and sees the crippled man walking normally.  He scopes out the lights and cameras for later.\nHolland and Rhiana go into town for information.  While he is off at the bar, a local begins harassing Rhiana.  Holland crushes his groin and neck to a cheering crowd and catches the attention of another of Molloch's henchmen.  Holland and Rhiana trick the man into returning to their hotel for a threesome, and Holland kills him by throwing a knife into his neck.  Rhiana is horrified and Holland demands she return home, as his mission is becoming dangerous.  However, Rhiana refuses to return home, wanting to see the Doctor killed in person.\nHolland decides to draw the Doctor out by kidnapping his sister Claire.  He breaks into her hotel room and awaits her return.  She returns, but with her female lover, and Holland is forced to wait for her to leave, hiding under the bed during their love making.  After she leaves, a male henchman comes in and begins rolling a joint.  Holland apprehends him while Claire showers.  He kidnaps Claire and throws the man off the balcony with the fire hose tied around his neck, hanging him publicly to cause a distraction for he and Claire to escape.  They go to a ranch owned by Max and Holland advises Max to go into hiding.\nUnbeknownst to Holland, Molloch has the local militia arrest Max, whom he tortures to reveal Holland and Claire's hideout.  When Molloch calls to negotiate, he inadvertently reveals that he knows their location.  Holland puts Claire in the trunk and he and Rhiana drive off.  Thugs sent by the US ambassador (whom Molloch has paid off) follow and, after a shootout and chase, crash their car and are killed.  In the rough chase, Claire dies in the trunk.  Holland and Rhiana buy a local farmer's truck and head to the village of Magdalena.  They are followed by the US ambassador and other thugs who also decide to head for Magdalena.\nWhen Holland and Rhiana arrive, they meet a man who owns a cafe and phone.  They go to his place to use the phone and are confronted by the ambassador and a thug.  Holland kills them both and calls Molloch, demanding he come alone to retrieve Claire from a nearby abandoned mine.  When they go to the mine, they find several disfigured men attempting to find any remaining opal.  They advise the men to leave because danger approaches, but they refuse, going into hiding only when they see Molloch's car approaching.  Molloch reveals that he has captured Rhiana's daughter, Sarah.  Panicking because they do not have Claire, Holland plays a tape recording of her voice.  Molloch runs into the open and the miners recognize him as the man who disfigured and tortured them.  They begin to approach his car and, becoming nervous, the thug holding Sarah is distracted and Holland kills him.  Sarah runs to Rhiana and the miners slowly encroach on the Doctor, killing him with their hammers and picks.

When they reach Willows House, they find it to be occupied and the current owner repeatedly denies them hospitality. One of the hunters attempts to force his entry into the house, but a giant octopus is released from its tank and sent after the intruders. One of the fleeing hunters is killed by the octopus, while the other is captured by the giant. The owner is a scientist, Dr. Eric Vornoff, and the giant is his mute assistant, Lobo. Vornoff explains that he will perform an experiment on the unwilling hunter, who dies on the operating table.In a police station, Officer Tom Robbins sees Lieutenant Dick Craig. There are now 12 missing victims, and the police still do not know what happened to them. The reporter behind the newspaper reports is Janet Lawton, Craig's fianc\u00e9e. Janet forces her way into the office and argues with Robbins, and vows to go to Lake Marsh to investigate. At the police station, Robbins and Craig have a meeting with an intellectual from Europe, Professor Vladimir Strowski, who agrees to assist the police in investigating the Marsh, but not at night. As night falls and another storm begins, Janet drives alone to Lake Marsh, but visibility is poor and she drives off the road and into a ravine. Lobo rescues her.Janet awakens to find herself a prisoner of Vornoff, who uses hypnosis to put her back to sleep. The following day, Craig and his partner drive to the area around Lake Marsh, a swamp. The partners also discuss the strange weather and mention that the newspapers could be right about \"the atom bomb explosions distorting the atmosphere\". The duo eventually discover Janet's abandoned car and realize she is the 13th missing victim. They leave the swamp while Strowski drives a rented car to the swamp.Janet awakens at Willows House. Vornoff assures her that Lobo is harmless, but the giant seems fascinated with the female captive and approaches her with questionable intent. Vornoff explains the giant is human and that Vornoff found him in the \"wilderness of Tibet\". Vornoff then hypnotically places Janet back to sleep. He orders Lobo to transport the captive to Vornoff's private quarters. Meanwhile, Strowski silently approaches Willows House and enters through the unlocked front door. While Strowski searches the house, Vornoff arrives to greet him. Their country of origin is interested in Vornoff's groundbreaking experiments with atomic energy and wants to recruit him. Vornoff narrates that two decades prior, Vornoff had suggested using experiments with nuclear power which could create superhumans of great strength and size. In response, he was branded a madman and exiled by his country. Strowski reveals that he has dreams of conquest in the name of their country, while Vornoff dreams of his creations conquering in his own name. By late evening, Craig and his partner return to the swamp and discover Strowski's abandoned car. The partners split up to search the area, Craig heading towards Willows House. Back in the secret laboratory, Vornoff uses a wave of his hand to summon Janet to his current location. She arrives dressed as a bride, summoned through telepathy. He has decided to use her as the next subject of his experiments. Lobo is reluctant to take part in this experiment, and Vornoff uses a whip to re-assert his control over his slave and assistant. Meanwhile, Craig has entered the house and accidentally discovers the secret passage. He is himself captured by Vornoff and Lobo.As the experiment is about to begin, Lobo is visibly distressed. Making his decision, Lobo rebels and attacks Vornoff. After a fight, Lobo knocks Vornoff out, releases Janet, and transports the unconscious Vornoff to the operating table. The scientist becomes the subject of his own human experiment. This time the experiment works and Vornoff is transformed into an atomic-powered superhuman being. He and Lobo physically struggle with each other, and their fight destroys the laboratory and starts a fire. Vornoff grabs Janet and escapes from the flames. Robbins and other officers arrive to help Craig. The police pursue Vornoff through the woods. There is another thunderstorm, and a lightning strike further destroys Willows House. With his home and equipment destroyed, a distressed Vornoff abandons Janet and merely attempts to escape. Craig rolls a rock at him and lands him in the water with the octopus.

He finds the tribe and witnesses a secret ceremony in which a young woman (Marpessa Dawn), entranced by beating drums, is consumed by a large carnivorous tree. Moran then nearly dies from 'jungle fever'.\nFive years later, recovered and back in Britain at his manor house, Moran is experimenting with the tree. He has brought it and the tribal drummer, Tanga (Jimmy Vaughan), back from the Amazon. They kidnap a young English woman, Susan Curtis (Sara Leighton), and Tanga feeds her to the tree. 'She'll become a part of the plant. And from it I'll get the serum to bring the dead back to life. She won't have died in vain', declares Moran. However, the experiment fails. A dead heart into which Moran injects the serum revives, but dies again after a short time.\nPolice Sgt Bolton (Edward Higgins) arrives via bicycle to gently question Moran about the missing Susan. Moran denies any knowledge of her. That night, at the local Fun Fair, Sally Norton (Vera Day), is working at a sideshow, dancing the 'hula-hula' to attract customers. When she takes a break, Jack Venner (Peter Wayn), who has fallen in love with her at first sight, introduces himself. But when the sideshow barker (Harry Ross) tries to drag Sally back to the show, Jack bests him in a fistfight, which costs Sally her job. Jack suggests that she see Moran about becoming an assistant to Moran's housekeeper, Margaret Santor (Joyce Gregg). Moran gives Sally the job over the objections of Margaret.\nAfter the suspicious Detective Inspector Brownlow (Maxwell Foster) questions Moran again about Susan's disappearance, Moran and Tanga extract more serum from the tree, although without a further sacrifice. Moran says that his English science can improve Tanga's juju, but Tanga is sceptical. Moran goes to London and picks up Judy (Joy Webster). Tanga feeds her to the tree, too.\nMoran offers Margaret's job to Sally, telling her that Margaret is dead. Margaret and Moran had been lovers before he went to the Amazon. She still loved him, but Moran said that he was tired of her 'middle aged jealousies' over the younger Sally, whom Margaret has correctly guessed that Moran is in love with. Moran strangled Margaret when she tried to stab him.\nSally tells Jack that she's frightened of Moran and will quit the next morning. But Moran refuses to let her go and confesses his love for her. Sally is appalled. Moran locks her in his laboratory. When Jack comes to find her, Moran tells him that she's left. Jack and Moran argue about Sally's whereabouts, and Jack goes to the police with his suspicions. The police have new evidence about Susan's disappearance - a torn shred of her dress found near Moran's house - and they and Jack go off to confront Moran. \nIn the laboratory, Moran brings Margaret back to life. She starts to attack Sally but drops dead before she can do Sally any harm. Moran ponders this, saying, 'Only a body. No mind'. Then he yells at Tanga, 'Your people cheated me! They gave me only half the secret!' He can raise the dead, but the result is a mindless zombie. Tanga, hands on hips, says defiantly, 'Our secret not for you. The brain for us only'.\nTanga then tries to feed Sally to the tree but fails. Jack and the police arrive as Moran and Tanga struggle. Sally escapes with Jack.

{"id": "tt2017561", "text": "The story takes place before Tang Sanzang got his disciples and embarked on the Journey to the West.\nA riverside village is terrorized by a mysterious aquatic creature. A Taoist priest kills a giant manta ray and insists that it is the demon. Sanzang, a self-proclaimed demon hunter, appears to warn the villagers that the animal is not the true demon. The villagers ignore him and, at the priest's provocation, string him up. The demon reemerges and kills many of the villagers. Sanzang frees himself and, along with the survivors, manages to beach the creature, which turns into a man. Sanzang then opens a book of nursery rhymes and begins singing to the demon. Annoyed, the demon attacks Sanzang. Another demon hunter, Duan, captures and turns the demon into a puppet. Sanzang tells to Duan that his master taught him a more humane approach and to use nursery rhymes to coax goodness out of demons, a tactic Duan scoffs at. Disillusioned, Sanzang meets his master and bemoans his lack of capabilities compared to more aggressive demon-hunters. His master reaffirms his humanist philosophy and sends Sanzang off again to find \"enlightenment.\"\nA couple enters an empty restaurant but the chef reveals himself to be a pig demon and kills them. Sanzang comes to the same restaurant, this time apparently filled with people. Sanzang sees through the illusion and recognizes them as reanimated corpses of the victims, as well as the demon's nine-toothed rake. Duan bursts into the restaurant and destroys all the corpses, and attacks the pig demon. She captures the demon in her magic bag to turn it into a puppet, but it bursts out of the bag and transforms into a huge boar, collapsing the building. Sanzang and Duan retreat. Duan then develops a strong limerence towards Sanzang after being impressed by his selfless ideals. She expresses her feelings, but Sanzang flees, not wishing to deal with romantic love in his quest for nirvana.\nSanzang's master advises him to tame the Monkey King demon Sun Wukong (trapped by Buddha) to subdue the pig demon. That night, he is captured by a gang that had also subdued Duan. It is later revealed to be a plot orchestrated by Duan to trick Sanzang into having sex with her. After Sanzang rejects her again, she has him imprisoned. The pig demon reappears and injures Duan but is chased off by a trio of rivaling demon-hunters. Duan views Sanzang's concern for her injuries as a romantic attraction. After Sanzang refuses her advances again, she destroys his book of nursery rhymes and he leaves.\nAfter days of traveling, Sanzang finally discovers a cave under a lotus garden, where Monkey King was trapped in for 500 years. Monkey King tells Sanzang to use a dancer to bait the demon. Duan appears and volunteers to dance. When the pig demon appears Monkey King easily subdues it, allowing Duan to turn it into a puppet. Duan then gives both the fish and pig puppets to Sanzang and offers her golden ringed weapon as an engagement band, but he rejects her again. She leaves after returning his nursery rhyme book, which she had pieced back together, although at random as she is illiterate.\nMonkey King tricks Sanzang into removing the seal on his prison and bursts out of the cave. Sanzang begins to pray to Buddha, and an enraged Monkey King rips the hair from his head. The three demon hunters appear to catch Monkey King but he effortlessly kills them. Duan returns and defends Sanzang, but the Monkey King mortally injures her. Sanzang admits he loves her, and Monkey King proceeds to vaporize her body. Looking at the nursery book again, Sanzang realizes Duan accidentally reassembled the words of his book into those of the Buddha Sutra. Sanzang summons Buddha, who defeats Monkey King with the palm of his hand. Sanzang then places Duan's golden ring on Monkey King, and it turns into his restrictive headband.\nSanzang tells his master that his suffering due to Duan's loss has helped him to enlightenment. Sanzang is then instructed to travel on a journey to the west (India) for the Buddhist sutras of Leiyin Temple, and it is shown that the Water Demon, Pig Demon, and Monkey King have been tamed and turned into humans named, respectively, Sha Wujing, Zhu Bajie and Sun Wukong.

Gnomeo's mushroom friend, Shroom, discovers that Gnomeo is still alive, carried off by a dog to a nearby park. He and Featherstone reach the park where Gnomeo climbs onto a statue of William Shakespeare (Patrick Stewart) and tells him his story. Shakespeare declares Gnomeo's tale similar to his own story of Romeo and Juliet, and that it is likely Gnomeo's will have a tragic ending as well.\nBenny uses Miss Montague's computer to order a powerful Terrafirminator lawnmower, seeking revenge on the Reds. The Terrafirminator arrives and initially works well, but goes out of control, destroying both gardens, and gets itself stuck while the gnomes wage a full-scale war. Gnomeo returns to Juliet with Featherstone's help, but the Terrafirminator frees itself. Gnomeo is unable to un-glue Juliet, stuck in the mower's path, and they share a passionate kiss as the lawnmower crashes into the tower and self-destructs. Realizing the consequences of their vendetta, Lady Blueberry and Lord Redbrick end the feud. Gnomeo and Juliet emerge, unscathed, from the ruins as the two clans celebrate. Miss Montague and Mr. Capulet come home to find their backyards a mess and scream at the damage. The Blue and Red gnomes create a new garden and celebrate their newfound peace. Everyone happily sees Juliet and Gnomeo off as they get married and drive away on a purple lawnmower, symbolizing the start of a Red-Blue family.", "title": "Gnomeo & Juliet", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q753677"}}
{"id": "tt0084503", "text": "Pink is a depressed rock star. At the beginning of the film, he appears motionless and expressionless, while remembering his father. (\"When the Tigers Broke Free, Part 1\") While Pink imagines a crowd of fans entering one of his concerts, but him receiving them in a fascist alter ego, a flashback reveals how his father was killed defending the Anzio beachhead during World War II, in Pink's infancy. (\"In the Flesh?\") The aftermath of the battle is seen (\"The Thin Ice\"), and thus, Pink's mother raises him alone, which affects Pink's childhood. (\"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 1\") A young Pink later discovers a scroll from \"kind old King George\" and other relics from his father's military service and death. (\"When the Tigers Broke Free, Part 2\") An animation depicts the war, showing that the death of the people was for nothing. (\"Goodbye Blue Sky\") Pink places a bullet on the track of an oncoming train within a tunnel, and the train that passes has children peering out of the windows wearing face masks.\nAt school, he is caught writing poems in class and is humiliated by the teacher who reads a poem from Pink's book (lyrics from the song \"Money\"). However, it is revealed that the bad treatment of the students is because of the unhappiness of the teacher's marriage. (\"The Happiest Days of Our Lives\") Pink imagines an oppressive school system in which children fall into a meat grinder. Pink then fantasizes about the children rising in rebellion and burning down the school, throwing the teacher onto a bonfire. (\"Another Brick in The Wall, Part 2\") As an adult now, Pink remembers his overprotective mother (\"Mother\"), and when he got married. After a phone call, Pink discovers that his wife is cheating on him, and another animation shows that every traumatic experience he has had is represented as a \"brick\" in the metaphorical wall he constructs around himself that divides him from all society. (\"What Shall We Do Now?\")\nPink then comes back to the hotel room with a groupie (\"Young Lust\"), only for her to annoy Pink to the point where he destroys the room in a fit of violence, scaring her away. (\"One of My Turns\") Depressed, he thinks about his wife, and feels trapped in his room. (\"Don't Leave me Now\") He then remembers every \"brick\" of his wall (\"Another Brick in The Wall, Part 3\"). His wall shown to be complete, and the film returns to the first scene. (\"Goodbye Cruel World\")\nNow inside his wall, he does not leave his hotel room (\"Is There Anybody Out There?\"), and begins to lose his mind to metaphorical \"worms\". He shaves all his body hair, and watches The Dam Busters on television. (\"Nobody Home\") A flashback shows young Pink searching through trenches of the war (\"Vera\"), eventually finding himself as an adult. Young Pink runs in terror, and appears in a station, with the people demanding that the soldiers return home. (\"Bring the Boys Back Home\") Returning to the present, Pink's manager finds him in his hotel room, drugged and unresponsive. A paramedic injects him to enable him to perform. (\"Comfortably Numb\")\nIn this state, Pink dreams that he is a dictator and his concert is a fascist rally. (\"In the Flesh\") His followers proceed to attack people. (\"Run Like Hell\") He then holds a rally in suburban London, indicating his mind has taken over. (\"Waiting for the Worms\") The scene includes images of animated marching hammers that goose-step across ruins. Pink then stops hallucinating and screams \"STOP!\", deciding he no longer wants to be in the wall. He is then seen cowering in a bathroom stall, silently singing to himself as a security guard walks past him. (\"Stop\") In a climactic animated sequence, Pink, as a rag doll, is on trial for \"showing feelings of an almost human nature\", and his sentence is \"to be exposed before his peers\". His teacher and wife accuse him, while his mother tries to take him home. The judge gives the order to \"tear down the wall!\" (\"The Trial\") Following a prolonged silence, the wall is smashed as Pink can be heard screaming. Pink is never seen again after this. Several children are seen cleaning up a pile of debris, with a freeze-frame on one of the children emptying a Molotov cocktail, after which the film ends.

{"id": "tt0803057", "text": "Doug Stauber is the assistant manager of a branch of Donaldson's, a supermarket chain in Chicago. He believes that he is a \"shoo-in\" for manager of a Donaldson's that is scheduled for construction just a few blocks away from his home. Everyday, Doug deals with the pressures of being the assistant manager. Among his ordeals are an unruly gang of teenagers loitering around the parking lot, the overwhelming amount of negative comments on the customer survey cards he collects (nearly all of which are caused by the gang's antics), a foreigner who constantly slaps him over a box of Teddy Grahams, and the rumors about him being a former Junior Olympics medalist in gymnastics. Then one day, Richard Wehlner and his family move in from Quebec, and he becomes assistant manager alongside Doug.\nSince Richard's arrival, it appears that he has replaced Doug as front-runner for the job. But it soon becomes clear that Richard has disadvantages of his own, such as a past substance abuse problem and a tendency to make inappropriate remarks. In one incident, both men are challenged by the board of directors over a sign posted on the deli section window, citing the deli clerk as Employee of the Month for \"cutting the cheese\". Richard admits being manager on duty when the sign was discovered, and explains that he had not realized that the phrase is derogatory to the American public (claiming that \"cracking the cheese\" is what Canadians say). The competition between Doug and Richard causes strain on their respective marriages. Doug is under financial pressure to get the job because he has begun to buy a house that he cannot afford if he is not promoted while his wife Jen ponders on going to night school. Meanwhile, Richard's wife Laurie and daughter leave him to temporarily move to her parents' home in Scotland when she sees he is losing control and reverting to his previous behavioral problems.\nOne day, while helping a customer in the parking lot, Doug is hit on the back of the head by a bottle of Yoo-hoo thrown by one of the gang members. In retaliation, he confronts the gang and sprays one of them with mace. Further worsening the situation is an incident in the break room, where a furious Doug throws some frozen Tater Tots toward the trash can and accidentally hits Richard's hand with one; Richard fakes an injury by wearing a wrist brace at work. Days later, Doug gives an apology speech at a local community explaining his actions during the incident and wins the respect of the community, assuring them that a beautiful day should not be spoiled by a few \"bad apples\". After the meeting, the board of directors, the assistant managers and the community leaders have a brief meeting, wherein Richard inadvertently refers to the gang as \"black apples\", infuriating the head community leader.\nAfter several attempts to eliminate each other as competitors, both Doug and Richard, along with another prospect, are summoned by the board of directors for a final interview. Richard's hopes are shattered when it is revealed that a drug test is required, as he has recently smoked marijuana. Shortly after the interview, Doug is given a call by Mitch and notified that he has landed the job, as Richard failed his drug test and the other candidate is too junior-grade for the position. He celebrates by doing cartwheels and backflips while crossing the street \u2013 finally confirming the earlier rumor about himself. Meanwhile, after reuniting with his wife, Richard and his family return to Quebec to his old grocery store, where he is reported to have become the store manager after singlehandedly stopping an accidental fire (which is rumored to have been started by Richard himself).", "title": "The Promotion", "meta": {"wikidata_id": "Q3532038"}}
