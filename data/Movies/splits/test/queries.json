There are no familiar or famous actors in it. It is about a band that is going to be playing their last show and it's in some big empty warehouse style place, maybe an old slaughterhouse? I can't remember exactly. So they have a couple of guys/friends/relatives???? following them around and they are filming them making a documentary about the band. I can't remember anything really about the characters or that but as the movie goes on, members of the band begin been killed off by a killer who we can't either see on screen or they are on screen but we just can't see the persons face because they are wearing something to cover it. I think there was a scene where one guy was skateboarding and then the killer shows up in a van and chases him down while he tries skateboarding away and then kills him. In the end, I think there are only two people alive, one is a band member and the other is a fan/girlfriend of someone/groupie/?????. So it turns out that the girl is the killer and she did it so that she and the guy could be together. She is an obsessed fan and I think she even tells him she is his number 1 fan. I think he rejects her and then she kills him. Not 100% sure there on that ending but that is what I kinda remember. Throughout the movie, there is punk/pop-punk kind of music playing. I think that is the kind of music that the band plays as well. Anyways I watched this years ago and I can not remember the title for the life of me.

There are no familiar or famous actors in it. It is about a band that is going to be playing their last show and it's in some big empty warehouse style place, maybe an old slaughterhouse? I can't remember exactly. So they have a couple of guys/friends/relatives???? following them around and they are filming them making a documentary about the band. I can't remember anything really about the characters or that but as the movie goes on, members of the band begin been killed off by a killer who we can't either see on screen or they are on screen but we just can't see the persons face because they are wearing something to cover it. I think there was a scene where one guy was skateboarding and then the killer shows up in a van and chases him down while he tries skateboarding away and then kills him. In the end, I think there are only two people alive, one is a band member and the other is a fan/girlfriend of someone/groupie/?????. So it turns out that the girl is the killer and she did it so that she and the guy could be together. She is an obsessed fan and I think she even tells him she is his number 1 fan. I think he rejects her and then she kills him. Not 100% sure there on that ending but that is what I kinda remember. Throughout the movie, there is punk/pop-punk kind of music playing. I think that is the kind of music that the band plays as well. Anyways I watched this years ago and I can not remember the title for the life of me. I am pretty sure it is just a one-word title but I could be wrong. Any help would be so appreciated and if you have any other questions, just let me know and I will get back as soon as I can.

The movie is about all the family member's different relationships with her.  There may have been some sort of twist at the end, an affair of some sort.

I want to say this was around 2009-2014.  The plot revolved around a man, who was wealthy or perhaps royal who just married a woman in private while he was off traveling the world.  No one in his family knew her before he married her.  He returns home with his new wife.  His family, all lives in the same large mansion.  No one in his family likes his new wife.  The movie is about all the family member's different relationships with her.  There may have been some sort of twist at the end, an affair of some sort.  I do think as the movie goes on, they all start to like her.  I think she redeems herself at some point, helping one of them in a crisis.  I think the wife is played by a well-known actress, but this movie flew under the radar.  I think it was set in the 1800s as I remember the home looking older and the clothing not being modern.  It could have been set in the early 1900s as well.  I keep thinking the movie name started with an E.  "}

I should not judge it based just on the way it looks\".  \nSo I started watching Nick again, and this is when I'm not sure if this even happened or my memory is just over exaggerating, but, the two main characters were in the kitchen frying something I think, and one of them does or says something that I can't remember, and the other guy says something like \"Dont do it\" or \"You don't know what you are doing\" but he keeps doing what he was doing anyway, and out of nowhere his veins starts going outside of the skin and he started screaming, I was so scared and inmediatly changed the channel, and I was like \"wtf is this, maybe I misinterpreted what was happening\". So I decided to change back to Nick. But I was wrong, that was really happening if my memory is correct, the last thing I remember was that blood started to come out of his veins, after that I turned off the tv for good, and stopped watching Nick for months."}

Anyways I remember it being actually really good but for the life of me and my mom we can't remember the damn name.\n\nThe Plot ( or at least what i remember ):\n\nThere's this teenage girl maybe 16-17 I think she had black hair but she lives with her abusive foster mom/grandma who abuses her and is general a horrible person. She goes to highschool and falls in love with a male teacher who is engaged. He is the only one who is nice to her and she falls in love with him and will do anything to be with him. She kills her foster mom with a kettle I believe, then she kills her social worker. Then there's this guy who has a crush on her who she lures into the attic with the proposition of sex before she kills him too. I remember it comes to a head when she confesses to her teacher and he turns her down. So she goes after his fiancee and he has to stop her from killing her, which makes her want to kill him for not wanting to be with her?? I think it ends with the house of fire and shes trapped inside of he ends up killing her???\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you so much for your help!!!!"}

They then (probably later in the movie) flies down the mountain in wingsuits, where one of them crashes and dies. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe gang later, possibly without the main character, blow up some trucks with gold in them, which falls back in the mine that it was taken from because they owe it to mother nature. Way later, The main character gets in a fight with people from the gang or people they know, which he hasn't met before, where he shoots and kills one of them, later finding out it was a girl he fell in love with earlier in the movie. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt either ends with the main character getting into a fight with the leader of the group on a boat in the ocean, where the main character gets saved my a helicopter, which the gang leader denies getting on, then getting hit by a big wave resulting in the ship tipping and him drowning, or it ends with the main character trying to save the gang leader, to which he denies getting on the helicopter, then getting hit by a wave and drowning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry that this post is such a mess and if it's all confusing."}

I remember watching this movie once...it was animated in a Pixar like style (the same style as Nemo, Zootopia, etc.) The whole cast was made up of anthropomorphic, bipedal animals.

However by the art style, voice acting, etc. you could clearly tell it was a low-budget ripoff much like Hoodwinked. The whole kingdom was controlled by a Wolf King with his army of wolves (all dressed in medieval knight armor and such). The Wolf King hated the Robin Hood fox and I think the plot revolved around the fox doing things and avoiding being captured. In one scene, the wife of the Wolf King tries to seduce the Robin Hood fox by locking the house door and slipping the key into her cleavage...a weird detail but I remember it very clearly. I also think the fox had a companion...but I cannot recall what animal the companion was based on. Another thing that I recall clearly is this weird monster character. The daughter of the fox believed in fairy tales and mentioned to her father the story of some kind of magical monster creature that could help them fight the wolves. I don't recall that well, but I think the monster looked something like a purple Incineroar...but scarier. The fox and his friend journeyed to a desert of some sort...and found a kind of ancient underground tomb or something? There was this whole bit about how they were trying to look for the monster...but the whole time it was stalking them and following them as they walked around its cave.

Then the fox went back to the wolf kingdom...I think he got captured by the wolves, put in a jail to await execution, but he escaped, and the end of the movie consisted of the wolf army chasing him, which is when the monster ally showed up, kicked some wolf ass, and everybody lived happily ever after.

They find themselves in a cave and something in that cave grants them superpowers, mostly related to telekinesis. They realize they can move things with their minds and stuff. At first they keep pranking  people with their new found powers, but one of them (lets say X), possibly the strongest telekinetic of them 3 starts going psychotic. He get aggressive for no reason and starts distancing away from his other 2 friends. Some stuff happens and X kills one of his friend in a telekinetic battle in air. Seeing that his mother's health is deteriorating, he decides to use his powers to steal money from people. One such attempt at a fuel station causes a blast and X is caught in it. He is hospitalized but escapes from there and till now his powers which were a secret, he decides to flaunt them in front of a new TV camera, and starts fighting with enforcement units who are deployed to restrain him. Knowing this, the last remaining friend meets with X and tries to stop him. Another telekinetic battle ensures, and in the end , his friend has no other choice but to kill X. The friend takes off from there before authorities can catch him.

I remember watching this movie as a kid but can't seem to remember the name. i only am able to recall a few things about the movie.\n\nSo the story goes something like this, we see 3 college students attend a party, and decide to wander into a restricted zone nearby. They find themselves in a cave and something in that cave grants them superpowers, mostly related to telekinesis. They realize they can move things with their minds and stuff. At first they keep pranking  people with their new found powers, but one of them (lets say X), possibly the strongest telekinetic of them 3 starts going psychotic. He get aggressive for no reason and starts distancing away from his other 2 friends. Some stuff happens and X kills one of his friend in a telekinetic battle in air. Seeing that his mother's health is deteriorating, he decides to use his powers to steal money from people. One such attempt at a fuel station causes a blast and X is caught in it. He is hospitalized but escapes from there and till now his powers which were a secret, he decides to flaunt them in front of a new TV camera, and starts fighting with enforcement units who are deployed to restrain him. Knowing this, the last remaining friend meets with X and tries to stop him. Another telekinetic battle ensures, and in the end , his friend has no other choice but to kill X. The friend takes off from there before authorities can catch him. In the end it is implied that the last friend is on a journey to uncover the truth of how they got their powers and how to manage it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks a lot!"}

I could be just altering the way I first saw Mouse Hunt, but the commercial had a more darker/horror vibe to it. Here is what I remember, it kinda felt like a fast paced commercial:\n\n\\-In a nicely white furnished kitchen: Two guys sit down to eat a bowl of cheerios when two mice/rats fall out of the box and into the bowl, the men proceed to jump on the table alarmed as the two rodents run off the table and onto the b/w checkered floor towards the camera/screen.\n\n\\-An orange fluffy cat teetering on top of grandfather clock before falling into a horde of rats/mice swarming the floor.\n\n\\-A beautiful woman with black hair in a bun style looking strait into the camera as a mouse jumps from on top of her head down her v neck dress/shirt.\n\nIts possible that my kid brain just reworked some Mouse Hunt scenes, but for some odd reason my brain has archived these scenes and is driving me crazy if this was actually a standalone film or not."}

I am 90% sure it was from the 2000s-early 2010s. It is in English. My memory is very foggy of it, but I distinctly remember the film seemed to have a blueish filter over it, and a creepy little girl (elementary school age) was the main antagonist. She mostly bothered her young peers, but her teacher, who i believe was a female, was also scared of her. There were multiple scenes in the woods. It might not actually be super creepy, we were pretty young. I do not remember what channel we were watching. I believe the antagonist had brown hair. From what we watched there was no supernatural aspect to the girl, she was just a sociopathic killer. That could\u2019ve changed later in the movie because we didn\u2019t finish it. \n\nEDIT: My cousin remembers a bracelet being a major plot point, and the little girl being a killer. She also is very insistent that it\u2019s a Lifetime-type movie and not a theater release, but i\u2019m not so sure.\n\nEDIT 2: Given the amount of comments here and this is still unsolved, i\u2019m also starting to be convinced it was a cheap weird Lifetime-type movie.

My memory is very foggy of it, but I distinctly remember the film seemed to have a blueish filter over it, and a creepy little girl (elementary school age) was the main antagonist. She mostly bothered her young peers, but her teacher, who i believe was a female, was also scared of her. There were multiple scenes in the woods. It might not actually be super creepy, we were pretty young. I do not remember what channel we were watching. I believe the antagonist had brown hair. From what we watched there was no supernatural aspect to the girl, she was just a sociopathic killer. That could\u2019ve changed later in the movie because we didn\u2019t finish it. \n\nEDIT: My cousin remembers a bracelet being a major plot point, and the little girl being a killer. She also is very insistent that it\u2019s a Lifetime-type movie and not a theater release, but i\u2019m not so sure.\n\nEDIT 2: Given the amount of comments here and this is still unsolved, i\u2019m also starting to be convinced it was a cheap weird Lifetime-type movie.

{"id": "dzw54e", "title": "[TOMT][MOVIE][2000s] Horror Movie About A Nonhuman Boy Who Only Eats Raw Meat Who Gets Taken In By A Couple", "description": " I watched this movie on Hulu a few years ago. It's a horror movie about a nonhuman boy who can only eat raw meat moving in with a couple who lost their son I believe. He's seen in the movie eating human, a raw steak at dinner with his new family, and a raw burger he requested at a diner. In the beginning scene he's walking with an old woman. They talk and then the old woman walks into the road and gets hit by a truck. Blood splatters on the boy's cheek and he licks it. I think there's a title card right after that scene.

When \"Mr. Spirit\" suggests a connection between math and music, though, Donald is intrigued. First, Donald discovers the relationships between octaves and string length which develop the musical scale of today. Next, Donald finds himself in ancient Greece, where Pythagoras and his contemporaries are discovering these same relationships. Pythagoras (on the harp), a flute player, and a double bass player hold a \"jam session\" which Donald joins after a few moments using a vase as a bongo drum. Pythagoras' mathematical discoveries are, as the Spirit explains, the basis of today's music, and that music would not exist without \"eggheads\". The segment ends with a sequence of live action musicians playing both jazz and classical music and Pythagoras' pals fading away.*\n\n*Donald learns that mathematics applies not only to nature, architecture, and music, but also to games that are played on geometrical surfaces, including chess, baseball, football, basketball, hopscotch, and three-cushion billiards. Donald even volunteers the game Tiddlywinks, but the Spirit does not pursue this option. Themes of Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass are scattered throughout the chess scene; Carroll himself was both a writer and a mathematician. The extended billiards scene, which features a non-speaking live actor, shows the calculations involved in the game's \"diamond system\", and Donald finally learns how to do the calculations, spectacularly hitting ten cushions in a single shot.*", "created_date": "2019-02-21T04:42:13+00:00", "author_name": "chandalowe", "replies": [{"id": "egy9awu", "body": "You have been given one point for this answer.  \n  Thanks for contributing!  \n\n  ^^^Time_Traveling_Hobo ^^^awarded ^^^to ^^^chandalowe ^^^\\(548\\)", "created_date": "2019-02-21T13:22:49+00:00", "author_name": "WhatIsThisBot", "replies": null}, {"id": "egxnb5s", "body": "Solved!", "created_date": "2019-02-21T05:01:49+00:00", "author_name": "Time_Traveling_Hobo", "replies": null}]}]}, "raw_description": "Two topics I remember specifically was the mathematics behind billiards/pool and musical instruments."}

{"id": "c5dh70", "title": "[TOMT][MOVIE][2000s] Obscure and bizarre film featuring monsters and a submarine.", "description": "This is an old movie I saw at my uncles house in Taiwan, it was a film on the HBO channel and it featured;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- The submarine docks at a city port during the night. It felt like a Victorian horror town of sorts)\n\n\\- In the city there were vampirelike creatures that chase the main characters a bit.\n\n\\- There were some Hebrew/or Arabic letterings on the submarine, (not completely sure, but it suggests it might be a foreign film, not English)\n\n\\- Later in the movie, there's a scene where a major character is in the giant submarine and a classic water breach in the submarine occurs. Then he takes a vial (blue colored liquid) which turns him into a \"enlarged human\", kind of like a \"mini-hulk\" but flesh colored. (clothes stretched till they break type of transformation) and escapes the submarine.\n\n\\- The submarine and the rest of the characters end up in a snowy/icy place, kind of like the base of operations, and the \"mini-hulk\" dukes it out with another \"mini hulk\", an side antagonist that took the same type of vial.\n\n\\- Inside the building there was a scene where a creepy face in the mirror turns the character that looked at it into dirt/dust. Mirror/painting only showed shoulder and up. Looks like a painting but the face moved a little, and I think the character could see a reflection.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy memories of this film is kind of hazy since it was almost 10 years ago, around 2010 and that's all I could really remember. But I thought the submarine and the monsters in the film could be used a indicator since its quite unique to this \"out there\" story. It wasn't an Chinese film because it had subtitles, but it might not even be in English, since I couldn't find a thing on google.

It felt like a Victorian horror town of sorts)\n\n\\- In the city there were vampirelike creatures that chase the main characters a bit.\n\n\\- There were some Hebrew/or Arabic letterings on the submarine, (not completely sure, but it suggests it might be a foreign film, not English)\n\n\\- Later in the movie, there's a scene where a major character is in the giant submarine and a classic water breach in the submarine occurs. Then he takes a vial (blue colored liquid) which turns him into a \"enlarged human\", kind of like a \"mini-hulk\" but flesh colored. (clothes stretched till they break type of transformation) and escapes the submarine.\n\n\\- The submarine and the rest of the characters end up in a snowy/icy place, kind of like the base of operations, and the \"mini-hulk\" dukes it out with another \"mini hulk\", an side antagonist that took the same type of vial.\n\n\\- Inside the building there was a scene where a creepy face in the mirror turns the character that looked at it into dirt/dust. Mirror/painting only showed shoulder and up. Looks like a painting but the face moved a little, and I think the character could see a reflection.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy memories of this film is kind of hazy since it was almost 10 years ago, around 2010 and that's all I could really remember. But I thought the submarine and the monsters in the film could be used a indicator since its quite unique to this \"out there\" story. It wasn't an Chinese film because it had subtitles, but it might not even be in English, since I couldn't find a thing on google.  Also it might be horror since I remember I was a little scared but this is biased since I was really young at the time."}

As she listens to the tapes her father tells her to go to certain locations, and when she gets to each location he describes memories of them together at each one of these locations.  Toward the end of the movie she is lead to an abandoned old building, she thinks her Dad is inside and she seemingly steps over some boundary as she enters.  You see a chair with someone in it, but only from behind, and as she approaches the chair hoping to see her Dad it turns out to be some decayed corpse or demon?  I honestly don't remember, but it turns out that her father leads her to hell I think?  During the whole time, her mother had been trying to get ahold of her leaving many messages that she never answered.  You hear the mother tell someone that her father killed himself?

The movie in the beginning leads you to believe the father left her and her mother.  She has to go to a pawn shop to find an old used cassette player.  As she listens to the tapes her father tells her to go to certain locations, and when she gets to each location he describes memories of them together at each one of these locations.  Toward the end of the movie she is lead to an abandoned old building, she thinks her Dad is inside and she seemingly steps over some boundary as she enters.  You see a chair with someone in it, but only from behind, and as she approaches the chair hoping to see her Dad it turns out to be some decayed corpse or demon?  I honestly don't remember, but it turns out that her father leads her to hell I think?

(Bare in mind, I was around 10, 7 years ago and I have a pretty bad memory) The film is set in a post world war 3 nuclear wasteland (I don't exactly remember), the main character is a former soldier(with a large sword for some reason) and he is a wanderer in the wasteland. He stumbles into a tent/trader. Who offers him water, the main character accepts but finds out it was a trap set by bandits. (Now this part is where I don't have a good grip on what happened next). He kills the bandits and is heavily wounded, he runs off and arrives at a camp run by a woman, accompanied by her son and maybe a servant or something? They offer shelter and our main character reluctantly accepts and over time develops a relationship with the woman, there is also something about water and how the woman lives above a water reservoir. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nApologizes for the bad grammar, English is my 3rd language.

The movie is about two white friends (I'll name them A and B) who got into jail and met a 'godfather'-ish person, he has a luxury room in prison which was pretty weird. He asked them to rob a tailor shop which has a bank under it and they'll get a big cut out of it. They did the job but were soon being hunted down by the godfather.

Likely, this movie is not very famous; Serbian TV programmes usually play movies that are either unsuccessful, like Gigli (starring JLo and Ben Affleck), or movies that are not a big success, like Adult World (starring Emma Roberts and Evan Peters). This movie only had Serbian subtitles, it was not synchronized. Also, I believe it was filmed either in 1990s or 2000s, because of the style, the topic, the music and the quality of video. (I don't remember any specific songs) The movie was about a 20-something woman that has long, blonde hair, is lean and tall, and her outfits were always sooo stunning and fashionable (mainly consisted of short skirts and crop-tops, or jeans and flowy blouses, or cute bright dresses, she dressed AMAZING). She is a virgin because she is looking for the right guy. Everyone finds her extremely attractive (she is GORGEOUS) and flirt with her all the time, but she rejects everyone. Except for this one guy. He has dark, longer hair (just shaggy, a little bit longer than Bradley Cooper in Hangover), darker complexion and his facial features resemble Roman. They end up together.\n\nI remember a couple of scenes:\n\n1. The woman is sitting on the hood of an older, red car (it might be Lada Riva) next to an old man who is looking at her provocatively and making comments. They are on a trip and they experienced some difficulties, and now they are waiting for the third person to solve them. The woman just ignores the old man or rolls her eyes at his comments.\n2. \\*The guy\\* rings the intercom of the building where \\*the woman\\* lives. She comes down. The weather outside is not the best (or it's nighttime, not sure). They look into each others' eyes for some time and speak a little. Then they hug for a longer time too. Finally, they start kissing. They go up to the woman's apartment as they're making out. Her apartment has vivid colours, especially a lot of blue between azure and cornflower. She might be a painter, or she might just have a lost of paintings in her apartment, but I'm not sure about this. They move to her bed. He takes off his shirt and she kisses his stomach and lingers. He looks at her and is a bit surprised that they might actually make love!!! They lay down, she over him, and he asks her something along the lines of 'Is this okay?' and she says 'Yes', completely assured. They continue to make out. She pulls away to look at him and notices something on his face, which she recognizes because it was an important part of the plot (but I didn't understand what it was). She asks him what is that? or how did he get it? and he is confused and asks 'What?'. She decides it isn't important and they just continue. This is the end.\n\nI tried looking it up on Google, but I couldn't find anything. It is not one of IMDb's Top 100 Romantic Comedies, and it's not 40-Year Old Virgin. It does not have any explicit sex scenes, but there is swearing and making out, so I would assume it is rated PG13. The main motive is the 20-something virgin, who is, in the opinion of many people in her life, gorgeous and could have any guy that she wants, but she waits for the right one, not necessarily the one that she loves, but the one that she really likes.\n\nI apologise for my not-so-good English, and I thank you in advance for helping me find this movie. I saw it (some parts of it) when I was younger and I wanted to watch it again ever since! I admired the chemistry between the two main characters and the taste in fashion of the leading female character. I hope that I provided enough details...

Likely, this movie is not very famous; Serbian TV programmes usually play movies that are either unsuccessful, like Gigli (starring JLo and Ben Affleck), or movies that are not a big success, like Adult World (starring Emma Roberts and Evan Peters). This movie only had Serbian subtitles, it was not synchronized. Also, I believe it was filmed either in 1990s or 2000s, because of the style, the topic, the music and the quality of video. (I don't remember any specific songs) The movie was about a 20-something woman that has long, blonde hair, is lean and tall, and her outfits were always sooo stunning and fashionable (mainly consisted of short skirts and crop-tops, or jeans and flowy blouses, or cute bright dresses, she dressed AMAZING). She is a virgin because she is looking for the right guy. Everyone finds her extremely attractive (she is GORGEOUS) and flirt with her all the time, but she rejects everyone. Except for this one guy. He has dark, longer hair (just shaggy, a little bit longer than Bradley Cooper in Hangover), darker complexion and his facial features resemble Roman. They end up together.\n\nI remember a couple of scenes:\n\n1.

I will try to provide as much information as possible. The time-frame is late 90s to early 2000s (pre-2005). The animation is 2D. I do not know whether it was an episode from a tv-series or a movie. I watched it in Greece, but the cartoon was most definitely not of Greek origin.\n\nThe plot goes like this: A boy of school age is in love with a girl. I remember them being on a school bus together. The boy gets a toy ring from a gumball machine and offers it to the girl. The girl rejects him so he gets frustrated and throws the ring away. Unbeknownst to him, a hand comes out of the ground and the ring falls on one of its fingers. The hand belongs to a creepy female ghoul/zombie creature that lives underground. The creature appears in the boy's room and claims that they are now married (or engaged perhaps). She uses one of her fingernails (or claws) to leave a mark on the boy's chin. That's pretty much all I remember.\n\nI've been trying to find this specific cartoon for years. I once posted at the Imdb \"I need to know\" board, but, sadly, no one there could pinpoint it. I have also posted on this subreddit before with no luck. Any help is appreciated.

I will try to provide as much information as possible. The time-frame is late 90s to early 2000s (pre-2005). The animation is 2D. I do not know whether it was an episode from a tv-series or a movie. I watched it in Greece, but the cartoon was most definitely not of Greek origin.\n\nThe plot goes like this: A boy of school age is in love with a girl. I remember them being on a school bus together. The boy gets a toy ring from a gumball machine and offers it to the girl. The girl rejects him so he gets frustrated and throws the ring away. Unbeknownst to him, a hand comes out of the ground and the ring falls on one of its fingers. The hand belongs to a creepy female ghoul/zombie creature that lives underground. The creature appears in the boy's room and claims that they are now married (or engaged perhaps). She uses one of her fingernails (or claws) to leave a mark on the boy's chin. That's pretty much all I remember.\n\nI've been trying to find this specific cartoon for years. I once posted at the Imdb \"I need to know\" board, but, sadly, no one there could pinpoint it. I have also posted on this subreddit before with no luck. Any help is appreciated.

The protagonist is a young woman who lives alone in some kind of boiler room complex.

Two of the agents are humanoid robots with brains in jars instead of heads, and one of them gets broken during the ensuing conflict. The girl eventually flees into the street (I can't remember if she is carrying or chasing one of her toys) and the authorities pursue her, including the broken  jar-head. The girl trips on some stairs and injures her leg, giving the agents time to catch up with her. The bubble creature emerges from the toy and there is a brief standoff between it and the agents before the creature is hit by a train and destroyed.

In the scene I remember that the male star of the movie is driving a car and hands a gun to an elderly couple, probably his parents, in the back of the car, where they commit suicide to eliminate the possibility of being eaten by the aliens.

It was indeed TommorowLand!!!!** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a movie whose name and actors involved I am forgetting. I do recall a few scenes which I can describe in detail.\n\n**First Scene I remember**\n\n* One of the scenes involves the protagonist going to an cabin/shed type house in the middle of forest/nature. It's raining hard. The protagonist comes here to find an object/fix the device which will allow him to time travel/jump. The antagonist eventually purses the hero here and his minions come into the house in tactical gear. The protagonist, along with an old man who helped repair his device, had setup traps of the like throughout the house. Eventually the protagonist escapes.\n\n**Second Scene I remember**\n\n* The protagonist jumps to the near future. Tall futuristic buildings line a busy subway/tram station. People are walking about. Blue holographic ads and such play around.\n\n**Third Scene I Remember**\n\n* The protagonist is in the far far future. Modern, grey and drab concrete buildings are scene scattered about under a grey overcast sky. The protagonist and antagonist face off but it's not the final battle.\n\n**Final Battle Scene**\n\n* The Antagonist and protagonist fight off in a tall building. THe building holds some importance to the time traveling device. It is hollow. Eventually their fight results in them falling down the middle of the building. There is a robot involved on the side of the protagonist but I may not remember it correctly. The device becomes broken at the end i believe.\n\nI hope this is helpful. I apologize if I don't have more information.

It was indeed TommorowLand!!!!** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a movie whose name and actors involved I am forgetting. I do recall a few scenes which I can describe in detail.\n\n**First Scene I remember**\n\n* One of the scenes involves the protagonist going to an cabin/shed type house in the middle of forest/nature. It's raining hard. The protagonist comes here to find an object/fix the device which will allow him to time travel/jump. The antagonist eventually purses the hero here and his minions come into the house in tactical gear. The protagonist, along with an old man who helped repair his device, had setup traps of the like throughout the house. Eventually the protagonist escapes.\n\n**Second Scene I remember**\n\n* The protagonist jumps to the near future. Tall futuristic buildings line a busy subway/tram station. People are walking about. Blue holographic ads and such play around.\n\n**Third Scene I Remember**\n\n* The protagonist is in the far far future. Modern, grey and drab concrete buildings are scene scattered about under a grey overcast sky. The protagonist and antagonist face off but it's not the final battle.\n\n**Final Battle Scene**\n\n* The Antagonist and protagonist fight off in a tall building. THe building holds some importance to the time traveling device. It is hollow. Eventually their fight results in them falling down the middle of the building. There is a robot involved on the side of the protagonist but I may not remember it correctly. The device becomes broken at the end i believe.\n\nI hope this is helpful. I apologize if I don't have more information. I believe this was a teen movie, or marketed as such kind of like the Maze Runner.\n\nThank you again TOMT folks for your time!"}

{"id": "b0afxv", "title": "[TOMT][Movie Trailer][2019] Surreal indie thriller, possibly shot and/or set in Houston, TX", "description": "Watched the trailer for this movie yesterday morning on Instagram (it was an ad in my feed). I was on my phone at the time and thought I'd look up the movie when I got home that evening, which I did. However, in that 10-hour span, I apparently misremembered the name of the movie as *Nothing Ever Happens*. After a lot of searching, I've come to realize that this must not not the name of the movie. It, or a similarly worded phrase, might have just been some descriptive text that appeared on screen. I couldn't discern much re: the plot, but here's a list of things I remember from the trailer:\n\n* Protagonist: bearded white male with dark hair, early-mid 30s, wearing glasses and a white button-up shirt, appears to be having a kind of psychotic break (this is the central conceit of the movie)\n\n* He is friends with another bearded white male, light brown hair, possibly in an olive drab army jacket, to whom he confesses some of what he is going through at a booth in a diner\n\n* The protagonist's love interest, or possibly another friend, is an asian woman, again, same age\n\n* There's one scene where the protagonist and the woman are on their knees, outside, hunched over, looking at a tiny american flag on a toothpick that's been planted in a pile of something, and the flag falls over\n\n* Numerous jump cuts of various cryptic/creepy situations, most of which I cannot clearly recall, over which the protagonist describes his ongoing, and worsening, break with reality. Got a strong *Memento* vibe from what I saw\n\n* The movie is filmed and/or set in Houston, TX (either the trailer itself mentions this, or the Instagram post did)\n\n* The movie has either just released, or is about to release\n\nI watched the stupid thing twice and thought for sure I'd remember it.

I was on my phone at the time and thought I'd look up the movie when I got home that evening, which I did. However, in that 10-hour span, I apparently misremembered the name of the movie as *Nothing Ever Happens*. After a lot of searching, I've come to realize that this must not not the name of the movie. It, or a similarly worded phrase, might have just been some descriptive text that appeared on screen. I couldn't discern much re: the plot, but here's a list of things I remember from the trailer:\n\n* Protagonist: bearded white male with dark hair, early-mid 30s, wearing glasses and a white button-up shirt, appears to be having a kind of psychotic break (this is the central conceit of the movie)\n\n* He is friends with another bearded white male, light brown hair, possibly in an olive drab army jacket, to whom he confesses some of what he is going through at a booth in a diner\n\n* The protagonist's love interest, or possibly another friend, is an asian woman, again, same age\n\n* There's one scene where the protagonist and the woman are on their knees, outside, hunched over, looking at a tiny american flag on a toothpick that's been planted in a pile of something, and the flag falls over\n\n* Numerous jump cuts of various cryptic/creepy situations, most of which I cannot clearly recall, over which the protagonist describes his ongoing, and worsening, break with reality. Got a strong *Memento* vibe from what I saw\n\n* The movie is filmed and/or set in Houston, TX (either the trailer itself mentions this, or the Instagram post did)\n\n* The movie has either just released, or is about to release\n\nI watched the stupid thing twice and thought for sure I'd remember it.

The movie starts with the boy being taken into question and then from his story flashing back to what he said happened. Any idea what the name of this movie is? It\u2019s driving me crazy,"}

So probably the year 2000. I was 9 or 10 years old and we used to see a lot of new movies from pirated videos. Friends and I saw American Pie 2 for rent in a corner shop. This was soon after the first film came out and well before any of us even knew about the actual American Pie 2.\n\nThe film started with two women making out, I think they were in a New York apartment, exposed brick  kind of thing. Think they had a conversation with a man after. The title AMERICAN PIE 2 was on screen - white text, bottom corner, faded in and out and looked legit. It seemed more of a drama though. None of the same actors obviously. Turned it off since it was weird and not a comedy. Had no reason to know it wasn't AP2 until that actually came out.\n\nCan't imagine this will be known unless someone older happened to also rent that film. But this has always bothered me."}

But during the episodes it would start off with them doing a IRL challenge related to the game that would be played at the \"knock-outs\". If it was a racing game, they would have a IRL challenge team vs team driving real cars. The looser team would then have to vote 1 person + the worst scorer from IRL challenge.

It takes place in a bigger city, i think either new york city or london, and mostly revolves around an underground theater/bar in a poorer side of town. The main is a female, i believe blonde in her 20s or 30s. I remember that she ends up living with the actors/actresses that work there. I think the acts also had a comedy focus. There was one actor that was particularly popular there, and i believe it was a cross dressing male.

The colors were muted/grey for the feel of the movie. It was in English I believe, but not necessarily the US. There was a very small cast, like a young girl (preteens) and her parent(s), and at least one other character.\n\nIt was scary to me as a kid but may have just been like a psychological movie. The girl would have really bad nightmares (maybe hallucinations). She would draw creepy pictures of a really basic white/grey castle (like a rook) with dark thick crayons/pencils, and either a monster or a fire or both with it. At one point a doctor paid a visit to her.\n\nI think she also lived in this castle or a small house on rolling green hills kind off on its own. I remember a panned out image of this.

I know there are lots of Christmas movies like this, but there was this one that I wanted to look for but never figured out. Two specific characters and associated scenes I remember from the movie:\n\n\\- 1 - Opening scene:\n\nAt a bus stop, a middle-aged white woman met an acquaintance (also middle aged white woman) from long back. While chatting, she lied about her needing to go back home soon as possible because she's got 3 kids waiting for her (or something along this line) just to get away, while in fact she is still single, no significant other to go back home to.\n\n\\-2- A bit later after opening scene:\n\nA girl of Hispanic decent (20s to 30s, straight black hair, with bangs) is in the car with her boyfriend/fiance (vaguely remember they were engaged).

While chatting, she lied about her needing to go back home soon as possible because she's got 3 kids waiting for her (or something along this line) just to get away, while in fact she is still single, no significant other to go back home to.\n\n\\-2- A bit later after opening scene:\n\nA girl of Hispanic decent (20s to 30s, straight black hair, with bangs) is in the car with her boyfriend/fiance (vaguely remember they were engaged). She was putting on a new pair of dangling earrings (I remember them red). She said her co-worker gave them to her as present.

When he gets there he finds a group of protesters outside his gate saying it's unnatural and that he should kill it (though I think there were some there to argue a life's a life and shouldn't be killed).

I feel like it was a low budget, straight to VHS type thing so this might be a long shot. Thanks!"}

I last watched it in maybe 2010-12.\n\nThere is an episode with an acidic scorpion that the teens are trying to hide from someone who's trying to get it, so they store it in a fridge, but it melts its way out, in the episode, a man cuts off the tongue or fingers of someone else for some reason.  \n\nIn another episode. There is a widespread illness that occured from touching a certain type of metal (I think poisoned silver) and the teens discover a cave with a dart trap in the walls with the quote \"one life over a thousand\" or something. \n\nAnother episode is to do with another teen who's part of the rugby team, he keeps sleep walking or getting brain washed or something and tried to strangle The main protagonist in his sleep. \n\nAnother episode is a bit hazy, but I remember the 3 protagonists get locked in a green house that fills up with a gas that knocka then unconscious. \n\nAnother episode is, they discover sputnik, and all j remember is they re release it at the end of the episode with a catapult. \n\nAnd fnally, I recall there being a clockwork bomb in like the lobby of a crowded school or college? And the teens disable it by channeling lightning with a kite through to it. \n\nMore points - the main teen lived in the jungle for a while, there are scenes of him catching flies with chopsticks, swimming with crocodiles, climbing up a very steep hill, playing the bongos. Idk it's all very hazy but this is as much as I remember. The main protagonist was blonde j believe. Thanks."}

Trailer: https://youtu.be/-nLG5ItAAI0\n\nI saw this in the early 2000s and think it was relatively recent at the time. It was a horror film I believe set in Europe in modern times (pretty sure it was in English) where some people around college age were in the woods and gradually killed off by masked figures. I want to say one scene involved a woman being trapped in or snared to a log before being killed.\n\nTowards the end of the film one young woman is in a decrepit abandoned pre-modern village in the woods and ends up being locked upstairs and these people with deformed faces come in and she somehow understands she's being kept alive for breeding stock so men of the village can have sex with her and produce non-deformed children to save the community.\n\nEDIT: I *believe* but am not sure that the enemies wore masks for the early part of the hunting/killing people and only after she was captured did she get to see their deformed faces.\n\nEDIT: holy crap apparently there are a lot of really rapey horror films about using women for breeding stock. EDIT: except it turns out in Plague Town that it's the *guy* who's kept alive and pressed to have sex with an eyeless teenage girl to improve their breeding stock.

Then reading plot summaries about how it's healthy isolated rural adults but deformed homicidal kids started sounding familiar, and a major plot point that I hadn't recalled but you guessed the film despite my overlooking the huge \"killer kids\" aspect.\n\nBut finally when I read the long review it clinched it because it describes the *guy* being taken into a room to have sex with a hot-bodied but mask-faced teenage girl with no eyes.

I want to say one scene involved a woman being trapped in or snared to a log before being killed.\n\nTowards the end of the film one young woman is in a decrepit abandoned pre-modern village in the woods and ends up being locked upstairs and these people with deformed faces come in and she somehow understands she's being kept alive for breeding stock so men of the village can have sex with her and produce non-deformed children to save the community.\n\nEDIT: I *believe* but am not sure that the enemies wore masks for the early part of the hunting/killing people and only after she was captured did she get to see their deformed faces.\n\nEDIT: holy crap apparently there are a lot of really rapey horror films about using women for breeding stock. EDIT: except it turns out in Plague Town that it's the *guy* who's kept alive and pressed to have sex with an eyeless teenage girl to improve their breeding stock.

It is an intriguing premise, and the film does well at only gradually divulging its sci-fi ideas. In fact, the first twenty or so minutes play out as a standard police detective action film before the time travelers emerge. And they are a creepy bunch at that, wearing synthetic skin and **robotic arms**; the first execution for future crimes is particularly eerie as we only hear it with glowing red light visible from a distance. The film trips up though when it tries to explain all its pseudoscience in greater detail with plot holes and inconsistencies in terms of the butterfly effects of altering the past and what happens when their bodies get exposed to air. There are also some crazy stereotype Neo-Nazi characters whose soul purpose in the narrative seems to be to provide an over-the-top chase scene through a restaurant kitchen (where else?). That said, the film does have some very novel chase sequences, including an extended one in which the protagonist has to work out whether he is driving through real dangers or merely holograms set by the future cops.

I can\u2019t tell if it was actually made in the early 2000\u2019s and made to \u201clook old\u201d or of it was truly old. It was both color and black and white.

I remember snippets of it, and always wondered what the name of the movie was.  \n\nTwo young children (a girl and boy) are running away (presumably) or get lost in the woods.  These scenes look extremely realistic, as if someone took a camera and filmed it. They seem to enjoy each other\u2019s company. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any talking in the movie. They encounter some kind of camp with people in hiding, all of the people upon seeing them are reaching out for them and chanting.  At one point, they come across a small town where Nazis are pillaging the town- lighting things on fire etc.  I remember a clip where the houses are burning and an elderly person is sitting there to the side in a chair watching it burn. In this part, all the scenes are black and white and look very realistic, almost like real footage, which they might be. The two children see large heaps of bones from people who died at one point.  I didn\u2019t watch the movie from start to finish, but the last thing I remember is an image of the girl standing sadly in the woods and you see blood on her and running down her legs (sorry I don\u2019t know if this means she starts her cycle or she was hurt etc).

I randomly saw this movie when I was younger in the early 2000\u2019s on TV. I can\u2019t tell if it was actually made in the early 2000\u2019s and made to \u201clook old\u201d or of it was truly old. It was both color and black and white. I thought it was a documentary at first because some clips looked extremely realistic (eg black and white video of Nazis burning down villages).  I remember snippets of it, and always wondered what the name of the movie was.  \n\nTwo young children (a girl and boy) are running away (presumably) or get lost in the woods.  These scenes look extremely realistic, as if someone took a camera and filmed it. They seem to enjoy each other\u2019s company. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any talking in the movie. They encounter some kind of camp with people in hiding, all of the people upon seeing them are reaching out for them and chanting.  At one point, they come across a small town where Nazis are pillaging the town- lighting things on fire etc.  I remember a clip where the houses are burning and an elderly person is sitting there to the side in a chair watching it burn. In this part, all the scenes are black and white and look very realistic, almost like real footage, which they might be. The two children see large heaps of bones from people who died at one point.  I didn\u2019t watch the movie from start to finish, but the last thing I remember is an image of the girl standing sadly in the woods and you see blood on her and running down her legs (sorry I don\u2019t know if this means she starts her cycle or she was hurt etc).  I have never been able to find the name of the movie. Apologies for the sensitive information- anyone  who can solve this will be much appreciated!\n\nEdit: just to narrow it down, I\u2019ve seen Schindlers List, Jakob the Liar, Defiance, Boy in the Striped Pajamas, Diary of Anne Frank, The Pianist, the Fiddler on the Roof, the Reader, It\u2019s a Beautiful Life, Remembrance, the Zookeepers Wife, Run Boy Run."}

We cant for the life of us remember the name, however, I remember the plot almost vividly.  \n\n\nThe movie is based around the untimely death of a father. Upon his death, his 2 kids (son and daughter, both late 20s-early 30s) come to the house to sort out their father's affairs. The son is a bit of an odd fella and a strange character. The daughter is really interested in finding out more about what happened and more about her father. As the movie gets to his climactic end the daughter stumbles upon a hidden part of the basement where there is a large glass wall and a single chair... once she turns the lights on the other side of the glass on, she sees a lady chained up (the lady is presumed to be her mother who they thought died a while ago). This lady is just skin and bones... stuff happens. The brother finds her and seemingly knowing all about it and took part in the capture of the mother. A fight between the 2 starts and the brother almost kills the sister, somehow a water pipe breaks and they have to fight to get out before drowning.  \n\n\nI have randomly thought of this movie for months now and can never find it when googling around. plz help lol."}

At the end of the movie they clean the place and restore everything.\n\nI've been searching for this movie for years but cannot find it. Please help."}

I'm not sure about the date, but I think I remember watching it in the movie theaters? I only remember two scenes in this movie.\n\n1. The main character (little boy) hurts his ankle, and has a \"doctor\" come in to examine it. It turns out this doctor is the antagonist, and has an ability to heal and to worsen injuries. So first, he heals the ankle completely, then reverts this, and turns the ankle into so much pain for the boy.

A man stops and extracts her from the crash (she's quite injured and not with it) and puts her in his vehicle and takes her back to his house.\n\nThe guy who abducts her tries to \"help\" her but he's clearly got some massive issues and neurological deficit and she's critically injured and as the movie continues she declines and dies. He bathes her I think, tells her more and more that she looks like \"Rosalie,\" the nurse sent by the government when his mother got sick when he was a child. (I believe the name was Rosalie, but I guess I could be misremembering). It becomes clear he's obsessed with this memory of the nurse. He dresses the woman up and has dinner with her (and at this point she's dead) and proposes to her and of course she doesn't answer. I think he eventually gets angry at her silence and...maybe dumps her body?\n\nWhile this is is happening -- after she disappears, her sister goes looking for her, and finds the small town nearest to this guy.

The memory kind of randomly poped into my mind today and I wont be able to sleep till I remember it."}

I watched the movie on Netflix about 3 years ago and (spoilers) it was about a girl who was kidnapped and held in a forest area with holes dug in the ground where she and other kidnapped girls were held. Major spoiler: it turns out the the kidnapper/killer isn't actually a kidnapper/killer but this is an extreme drug rehab.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe main twist of this movie is that the kidnapper/serial killer is not actually a serial killer, but a super extreme drug rehab dude. I don't know if the other girl's with the main character were actors or other rehab patients, but the entire ending was about the rehab.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few things I think I remember:\n\nAlmost the entire movie is from the main character kidnapped girl's point of view. She tries to help/feed other girls who are underground.\n\nThe girls underground, at least from the main character's point of view, were sometimes left to starve and I think she broke the rules by trying to feed them through their straws?\n\nWhen she's above ground, she's kept chained or tied to a tree.\n\nI think she tries to escape at some point by hiding or using a garden handheld shovel. Maybe.\n\nThe end of the movie is like a documentary style interviewing a previous \"kidnapped\" girl (not main character) describing how this extreme rehab saved her life and she's so grateful for the experience.\n\nNo major/well-known actors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis movie is driving me crazy.

I watched the movie on Netflix about 3 years ago and (spoilers) it was about a girl who was kidnapped and held in a forest area with holes dug in the ground where she and other kidnapped girls were held. Major spoiler: it turns out the the kidnapper/killer isn't actually a kidnapper/killer but this is an extreme drug rehab.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe main twist of this movie is that the kidnapper/serial killer is not actually a serial killer, but a super extreme drug rehab dude. I don't know if the other girl's with the main character were actors or other rehab patients, but the entire ending was about the rehab.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few things I think I remember:\n\nAlmost the entire movie is from the main character kidnapped girl's point of view. She tries to help/feed other girls who are underground.\n\nThe girls underground, at least from the main character's point of view, were sometimes left to starve and I think she broke the rules by trying to feed them through their straws?\n\nWhen she's above ground, she's kept chained or tied to a tree.\n\nI think she tries to escape at some point by hiding or using a garden handheld shovel. Maybe.\n\nThe end of the movie is like a documentary style interviewing a previous \"kidnapped\" girl (not main character) describing how this extreme rehab saved her life and she's so grateful for the experience.\n\nNo major/well-known actors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis movie is driving me crazy.
