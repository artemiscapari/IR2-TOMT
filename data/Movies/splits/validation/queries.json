In this reality she is being chased by a black fog/ sludge creature, and she meets a mime who juggles. This mime becomes important to the plot in some way (possible love interest at the end).\n\nNow from this point on I can only remember a few scenes and tidbits from the film so bare with me, \n\nOne scene I remember very vividly is that the main character attempts to enter a new part of the world, but is stopped by a manticore creature (body of a big cat, face of a human, wings and blue/purple in colour). He says that if the girl can solve a riddle she may enter but if not he\u2019ll kill her. I can\u2019t remember whether she answers the riddle correctly or not, but she then tricks the manticore with a riddle of her own and is able to get away while it\u2019s distracted. \n\nThe next scene I remember is that the main character is in a room full of mirrors and there is another evil female character (can\u2019t remember appearance) and she faces off with her and gets some key item she needs to escape the world or something along the lines of that. \n\nLast scene is when she escapes to the real world and she is at a circus/circus auditions. The mime she befriended was at the auditions too and it\u2019s as if they\u2019ve met before. He juggles and they hit it off I\u2019m pretty sure.

One of the windows passes over and reaches his eyes, he opens it up to see two girls, it\u2019s an interactive cam-girl advertisement, the guy and them have a quick chat before the girls reveal their breasts to him which I guess is a way of teasing him for what\u2019s to him if he chooses to visit the site. He smiles, and after a moment says bye then pinches the hologram window closed.   \n\n\nAnother scene, I don\u2019t know if this was from the same movie or not, takes place in a gymnasium that\u2019s lit only by a spotlight which is shining down on two men. One of whom looks like Terry Crews, and the other looks like Michael Hall. The final character in the scene is the protagonist who walks in on the two, the character who looks like Michael gives our character a brief monologue before releasing the man who looks like Terry Crews from his catatonic state, controlling him to fight our main character with the usage of nano machines."}

The idea was the viewers write their own story and send it to the show and they will pick someone's story and have their actors play it out and be aired. I had two DVDs of this show and I can remember one title of a story is, \"Little Brother For Sale\". In this episode an older brother has to babysit his unruly little brother who wants to eat ice cream from breakfast. They go to the park and the younger brother gets stuck in a tree.

The premise of the show was that they were stories written by kids. The idea was the viewers write their own story and send it to the show and they will pick someone's story and have their actors play it out and be aired. I had two DVDs of this show and I can remember one title of a story is, \"Little Brother For Sale\". In this episode an older brother has to babysit his unruly little brother who wants to eat ice cream from breakfast. They go to the park and the younger brother gets stuck in a tree. There is also some neighborhood weirdo that is obsessed with vegetables and he offers to buy the little brother to help with his garden.

I think he was holding a sword or maybe he was holding onto a rope on the side of a cliff/wall/etc. From a distance, I guess his stance made him look like he was crouching on what only seemed to my 8-year-old brain at the time as Green Goblin's Glider from Spider-Man (2002).

The two girls go to school together in the same grade and Michelle is very forceful about being best friends with Sarah. Michelle keeps pressuring Sarah to do bad things. The first thing Michelle has Sarah do is to take an end of a piece of barbed wire, while Michelle holds the other, and they pull it across a path where kids from their school run and play. Sarah backs out and Michelle throws a fit, and takes Sarah's butterfly necklace as an apology. The next thing I remember is it it Halloween and Michelle has put razor blades into reeses peanut butter cups and given them to kids.

After that, there's a part where Michelle tricks Sarah to going into Sarah's shed, which her dad told her not to ever go in(I slightly remember that might've been where her mom died?). So Sarah goes in, and Michelle locks the door with a hatchet and sets it on fire. The dad saves Sarah, barely, and finally starts to believe her that Michelle is evil. \n\nThat's all I clearly remember, but here are some bits and pieces I cant quite fit into the story\n\n-There is a blonde lady that the dad eventually begins to fall for, I think she might've been a psychologist for Sarah\n-They find a clue that leads them to a buried body, not sure who's\n-The movie ends in a field, where Michelle is hunting Sarah and is killed by.. someone with a hatchet\n\nI also remember that the movie's title was just one word.

One has a sack of money, presumably the one at the bottom end. They're both at odds with each other but have to work together to survive and so the bus or whatever doesn't fall down the hill. If I recall the ending, one gets out and the other falls to his death with the bus or whatever vehicle they were in. Although the main premise may not be them being stuck in this vehicle on this edge, it could be and it certainly is a key detail."}

{"id": "8wktsk", "title": "[TOMT][Movie] 1980s or late 70s low-rent Conan/Beastmaster knock-off I saw aired on late-night TV about 10 years ago.", "description": "I've been trying to find out the name of this movie for a solid decade. It aired in the middle of the night on TV and my husband and I both watched a good chunk of it. \n\nAll I can remember from the movie is that the protagonist was some awful knock-off, low-rent version of Conan the Barbarian meets Beastmaster meets He-Man. The movie was a live-action fantasy, presumably set in the distant past, and clearly filmed in the 80s or late 70s. The villain was some kind of scantily-clad sorceress/enchantress who had a headdress that reminded me of She-Ra. \n\nThe acting was HORRIBLE, like, direct-to-video horrible. No one recognizable in the movie. Definitely in English and not dubbed.\n\nI remember exactly two quotes and partial scenes. The first is Low-Rent Conan demanding that the Villainess hand over some magical medallion. The villain parts the neckline of her white, semi-sheer dress to reveal a giant ass gold medallion with green jeweled accents on it.

The movie was a live-action fantasy, presumably set in the distant past, and clearly filmed in the 80s or late 70s. The villain was some kind of scantily-clad sorceress/enchantress who had a headdress that reminded me of She-Ra. \n\nThe acting was HORRIBLE, like, direct-to-video horrible. No one recognizable in the movie. Definitely in English and not dubbed.\n\nI remember exactly two quotes and partial scenes. The first is Low-Rent Conan demanding that the Villainess hand over some magical medallion. The villain parts the neckline of her white, semi-sheer dress to reveal a giant ass gold medallion with green jeweled accents on it.

It opened with what I think was a flashback from the life of the main character. She is a little girl and is dancing with her grandfather (?) on the deck of a ship, in a big crowd of other dancers. There is some kind of accident where a cable under tension snaps across the deck and cuts everyone in half except the little girl, because she is shorter than everyone else. The scene ends with her standing among all of these dead bodies.

This time frame is so wide because I can't recall the year when we got Digital terrestrial television at home, year that was for sure when the movie aired, but I know it was before the visual reworking in 2010. I also remember airing on the \"evening film\" spot (if that makes any sense). It aired once\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I remember however, is how the plot goes and certain shots:  \n\nSo, The movie begins with a group of children getting off school and going home on an orange bright crepuscular evening. They talk about how much they would like a life of eternal playtime, free of school. Then they come across a strange pontoon, showed in a shot zigzagging across the screen, on a orange-colored ocean, and ending strangely with a small cubicle, like if it has been cut off of something. After closer inspection by the kids, they get approached by an old man that tells them that there was an amusement park here where he had great fun with a friend when he was younger, but now both of them are gone.  when the old man goes away, one of the kids founds in the cubicle a spool of tickets, which when removed opens some sort of portal to the amusement park.\n\nwhen they go into the park, they meet the two \"gatekeepers\", which are two creepy elongated and somewhat humanoid figures with woman voices. They tell the kids that the park is all theirs and they can do whatever they want, until the park closes. Which they do, splitting up into groups and testing the diverse rides and games. They have no intention of getting out since there is literally no one, including personnel, in the park. \n\nBut, after a while, they have the impression of being observed and it seems like the rides have eyes. One of the kids meets a really strange and pale girl with a black dress and a cloth doll that seems \"out of older times\". She tells him moments later than she has been trapped in the park for over 30 years and that all the other children where turned into the rides and games they used prior to that if they didn't quit in time. \n\nAfter this revelation, the kids all gather together and try to escape. But the portal is closed and the gatekeepers tell them that they have to go to certain location to do certain task in certain rides, the first being a roller coaster made of cheese with  90\u00b0slopes. They nearly fail in the last ride in a freak show house, being all turned into pieces of stalls. But the pale girl helps them completing the trial, saving all of them, including the children previously trapped.\n\nThe films ends on the group escaping. Except the other children her, being reunited with the old man from earlier in an \"un-cursed\" version of the park, when they will live forever happy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've searched if Gaumont, which distributed a lot of cartoons and movies to Gulli, actually distributed or produced said movie in the timeframe I've given, but the results weren't satisfying.\n\nI also don't know if the movie was TV only or was distributed on DVDs too.\n\nWhat is motivating me to find at least the title of this is how strange, unique, eerie and even borderline scary (for a younger audience that is) the art style and visuals could get, especially in that park (those gatekeepers looked like straight out of a Burton movie I swear). But also because I've never heard of this movie from anyone except when I saw it that evening !\n\nThis is now the part when you all come!

She wants to go look for it, but it says the address doesn't exist. From the exchange of letters, she finds out more about her boyfriend because the girl and her boyfriend went to the same school. \n\nThe schoolmate girl starts getting sick and her mom and grandfather wants to get her to the hospital but they're snowed in and the ambulance takes a long time to get through. The grandfather refuses to wait for the ambulance because it reminds him of how his son died, so he piggybacks her and runs through the snow.\n\nThe movie ends with the original girl and her new guy on a snowy mountain yelling out their heart's content into the mountains, addressed to the dead guy. \n\nI really enjoyed this movie, so if anyone can help me find out, it's much appreciated!"}

{"id": "jvtvmm", "title": "[TOMT][Movie][1980s] Movie about Wishes and Memories", "description": "Ok, so I remember this movie that used to be on TV, I'm mid 30s, but I don't know anyone else who remembers it. It was about a kid who is given the power to make wishes. But as he he wishes, he loses a memory. At first, it's not a big deal, but the consequences of his wishes, and therefore what memories he has to give up, raises as the film progresses. \n\nI also remember a sad scene where he makes an important wish, and the memories are basically represented as these glass orb Christmas decorations.

I don\u2019t recall any humans in the movie, although they might have appeared in minor roles with no dialog as with Lobo. It was in color and had a 1960s feel, but it could possibly be from the 50s through the early 70s. I\u2019m guessing that it was inspired by or trying to copy Legend of Lobo, which would put it after 1962."}

It was British, and I think it was based on a novel. It wasn't fantasy/horror per say, but it definitely had Gothic horror/ghost story elements and a few minor scares. A rich old British woman is dying and gets a young writer (who is quite shy/troubled) to write her memoirs. The film alternates between the old lady's memories and the present. I think the old woman tells the novelist she will tell her three secrets, or something like that?\n\nThe memories involve twin girls growing up in an English mansion in the countryside like the 1940s or maybe earlier. Then staff in the house notice that the girls are too attached (and kind of creepy) and I think they're separated. There's a plot twist somewhere in the film that they were actually triplets and the old lady was hiding that from the novelist. When the girls are teenagers, they start having conflicts because one of them falls in love with a gardener (?). I think they straight up murder someone by pushing them down the stairs or something like that. There's a threat of them losing the mansion (?) and one of them burns down the entire mansion (I remember a shot of her on fire) and only one girl (the old woman) seems to escape. I think the reason the girls were isolated is that they were the children of incest in a wealthy family, and so grew up in secret in the mansion, but I could be conflating it with another film.\n\nIn the present, the novelist is investigating the truth about the old lady and ends up finding the ruined mansion near the old lady's house. She explores it and I think finds someone living there? Also, there's a second old lady who seems mad, who wanders around at night and who the novelist finds digging in the garden with her hands, saying something like \"they're under the earth\". A plot twist is that the novelist was also a twin and her sister died when she was young, and she blames herself for it.\n\nI can't find the film by googling keywords, because \"twins\" and \"mansion\" and so on are a bit generic.

I also can't find it anywhere online. I'm not sure if it's a Japanese movie or a Korean movie but here's the description:\n\nThe main character is a quiet woman who works at a cafe. She meets a handsome artist in the cafe one day who asks to paint her. She accepts and eventually falls in love with him and his art. As the movie goes on, the artist's ex girlfriend comes back to him saying that she's pregnant. He tries to hide it from his current girlfriend, the cafe girl, until she finds out. Thinking that he's cheating on her, the cafe girl eventually goes crazy and kills the ex girlfriend and then kills her boyfriend and finally herself. Before she kills herself, she uses the artist's paint to paint his entire body white and hers bright red (or vice versa) as she lays down to die in bed next to him.\n\nI hope this is enough and isn't too vague. That last scene involving the paint is the scene that stands out the most. I don't think it won any awards or anything, not a particularly talked-about movie anywhere. I'm pretty sure the title of the movie is a woman's name but I may be mistaken. Thanks in advance!\n\nEDIT: I watched it on a streaming service.

Before she kills herself, she uses the artist's paint to paint his entire body white and hers bright red (or vice versa) as she lays down to die in bed next to him.\n\nI hope this is enough and isn't too vague. That last scene involving the paint is the scene that stands out the most. I don't think it won any awards or anything, not a particularly talked-about movie anywhere. I'm pretty sure the title of the movie is a woman's name but I may be mistaken. Thanks in advance!\n\nEDIT: I watched it on a streaming service. I can't remember if it was On-Demand, Netflix, or Hulu but it was something like that."}

Moments after this two random women seeking shelter from the rain knock on the door and ask for just that.

He attempts to hurriedly hide the body while getting them some tea, though the one them finds it.I don't really remember the rest the movie, aside from the end in which the villain, who was thought to be two people is actually one man appearing as himself as well as an Australian stuntwoman (who was actually his accomplice he simply takes on her identity after they no longer are accomplices) gets caught after burning down a boat and being chased by the protagonist.

They end up leaving it and they get a bit concerned about their safety. Now this is towards the middle of the film. There was a women in a hijab scared during the army\u2019s search in the desert. She was alone, and scared and didn\u2019t know any English. So, it was difficult for the army men to understand her. They end up bringing her along to a camp to calm down and rest since she seemed hurt and traumatized. Now, there\u2019s like a camera in a tent. The camera shows the women laying down in her bed, but there\u2019s something strange about this particular women. While the army men are outside, the women is alone in the tent. She then becomes thirsty for water. She sits up and sees a water bottle across the tent, but instead of walking towards the bottle like a normal human, she instead extends her arm and it turns into a 3 foot length arm and grabs the water bottle and drinks from it. Then she extends her arm again to put the bottle back. The next part is towards the end. The army men wake up and they finally realize that this women isn\u2019t a normal person, but it\u2019s too late for them. She ends up devouring most of them besides a few. The few that survived grabbed guns and ran out the camp ASAP. They threw molotov\u2019s on the tents to burn her. She then screams in agony and gets out of the camp to get the few survivors. But she fails when all three of them start to shoot at her nonstop. She dies and the army men try to catch their breathe and realize what the hell just happened. \n\nI\u2019d be surprised if anyone knows what this film is called, but this have always been a somewhat of a blurry memory for me.

{"id": "798a1x", "title": "[TOMT] [TV Show] There's a really bad tv show episode that played on Showcase where two people were stranded in the ocean and a guy in a pirate hat rescues one of them from a shark by swinging from a boat", "description": "Less than a week ago I had to watch this terrible tv show for 20 minutes that was playing on the treadmill TVs at the gym. I could only read subtitles for this reason. I believe this TV show played on Showcase and I remember it was really bad with cheesy acting. No notable actors I think I've seen before.\n\nAnyway, here's what I remember from the episode:\n\nThere were two people, a man and a woman, both probably in their 30s, stranded in the ocean on debris. The two were being circled by a shark. \n\nThere were two people on a large boat searching for them. An older guy and a guy with a pirate hat on. The older guy captained the ship and thought the pirate guy was an idiot. At one point he took a feather off the guy's pirate hat and threw it in the ocean.\n\nThe woman stranded on the debris took out her reading glasses and made a telescope out of them and her and the guy found a buoy of some sort that was solar powered. They paddled their debris to it and got on. I remember the guy took out a windows tablet from his jacket and plugged it into the buoy somehow. The tablet also almost fell into the water as the shark hit the buoy.\n\nTwo new people that are somewhere on land and in a building radioed or phoned the boat. One of these two is a man and the other a woman, both young.\n\nThe pirate guy on the boat spots the two on the buoy and tells the older captain. Then he starts saying generic pirate lines and the captain looks annoyed at him. All of the sudden, the boat's engine breaks before they get to the buoy.\n\nThe guy on the buoy dives off to lure the shark away.

I could only read subtitles for this reason. I believe this TV show played on Showcase and I remember it was really bad with cheesy acting. No notable actors I think I've seen before.\n\nAnyway, here's what I remember from the episode:\n\nThere were two people, a man and a woman, both probably in their 30s, stranded in the ocean on debris. The two were being circled by a shark. \n\nThere were two people on a large boat searching for them. An older guy and a guy with a pirate hat on. The older guy captained the ship and thought the pirate guy was an idiot. At one point he took a feather off the guy's pirate hat and threw it in the ocean.\n\nThe woman stranded on the debris took out her reading glasses and made a telescope out of them and her and the guy found a buoy of some sort that was solar powered. They paddled their debris to it and got on. I remember the guy took out a windows tablet from his jacket and plugged it into the buoy somehow. The tablet also almost fell into the water as the shark hit the buoy.\n\nTwo new people that are somewhere on land and in a building radioed or phoned the boat. One of these two is a man and the other a woman, both young.\n\nThe pirate guy on the boat spots the two on the buoy and tells the older captain. Then he starts saying generic pirate lines and the captain looks annoyed at him. All of the sudden, the boat's engine breaks before they get to the buoy.\n\nThe guy on the buoy dives off to lure the shark away. After the shark chases the woman dives off and swims to the boat.\n\nThe guy looks like he's about to be eaten by a shark by a small, unmanned submarine comes up from nowhere and lifts him. The two people on land turn out to be controlling the sub. It's going too slow though so it looks like the shark still might get the guy as it's heading toward the boat.\n\nAs the submarine is about to reach the boat, the pirate guy gets to the top of the boat, shouts a classic pirate line, puts a knife in his mouth like pirates do, and swings dow the side of the boat with a rope.

I have reviewed all the shows listed in the [CBS Summer Playhouse](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346222/?ref_=ttep_ep_tt) as that is the right time period and presentation, but it is not on that IMDb listing.\n\nThe premise is in the Future, police have advanced technology and methods to track down perpetrators of crimes. I don't remember too many details about the gadgets, but they had hand-held devices to find people, probably seeing residual heat, or hearing their heartbeats. A future criminal travels back to our present and a future cop follows him back. The future cop then meets the present day cop who would go on to invent all the future policing gadgets and literally write the book on advanced criminology, but we met them when they are still a rookie beat cop, who's ideas are still being developed.  \n\n\nThis sounds a lot like [Continuum](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1954347/?ref_=ttmc_mc_tt) (2012-2015) but my show definitely aired in the 80's -90's.  \n\n\nScene I remember: Future Cop tries to convince some people that he's from the future, so they ask him to make a prediction. He predicts that America will get involved in a war in a \"tiny little country in Asia called Vietnam\". They dismiss him as crazy, because that has already happened.\n\nRunning Gag: The Present Cop says some long winded reasoning for a course of action, and Future cop repeats it back in a pithy epigram as it is would eventually become part of their standard police training.   \n\n\nLook: I remember a lot of scenes shot at night, in a nondescript city.

I have reviewed all the shows listed in the [CBS Summer Playhouse](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346222/?ref_=ttep_ep_tt) as that is the right time period and presentation, but it is not on that IMDb listing.\n\nThe premise is in the Future, police have advanced technology and methods to track down perpetrators of crimes. I don't remember too many details about the gadgets, but they had hand-held devices to find people, probably seeing residual heat, or hearing their heartbeats. A future criminal travels back to our present and a future cop follows him back. The future cop then meets the present day cop who would go on to invent all the future policing gadgets and literally write the book on advanced criminology, but we met them when they are still a rookie beat cop, who's ideas are still being developed.  \n\n\nThis sounds a lot like [Continuum](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1954347/?ref_=ttmc_mc_tt) (2012-2015) but my show definitely aired in the 80's -90's.  \n\n\nScene I remember: Future Cop tries to convince some people that he's from the future, so they ask him to make a prediction. He predicts that America will get involved in a war in a \"tiny little country in Asia called Vietnam\". They dismiss him as crazy, because that has already happened.\n\nRunning Gag: The Present Cop says some long winded reasoning for a course of action, and Future cop repeats it back in a pithy epigram as it is would eventually become part of their standard police training.   \n\n\nLook: I remember a lot of scenes shot at night, in a nondescript city. There was probably no budget for this show.\n\nCast: No idea.  \n\n\nAny help on this would be appreciated. "}

{"id": "cxsbot", "title": "[TOMT][Movie] Romantic movie 90's to mid 2000s, main leads keep just missing each other until they meet up at end", "description": "I watched parts of this movie with my mom, likely from Netflix back when they delivered DVDs.  I don't remember much except that it was a romance or chick flick type movie.  I think the movie followed the woman completely or at least most of the time, and the main gimmick was that the audience knew the man and woman would be soul mates but they kept showing scenes where they would just miss running into each other.

Whatever it is, the man on the motorcycle finds in on a beach after travelling around the countryside with the kid for a while, and in a change of heart (he's kind of a selfish person) he gives it to the kid, despite it being a valuable piece of jewelry that he could sell for money, and then the rest of the movie is basically a bunch of short skits between the kid, the motorcycle guy, and two side characters they picked up over the course of their adventure, who get pushed around by the man on the motorcycle a lot for comedic effect.\n\nI remember a couple scenes from the movie explicitly. First is a scene early on where the man on the motorcycle takes the kid to a horse racing event and let's him pick the numbers of the horses he thinks will win. The kid's numbers almost win over and over again, and the man gets more comedically frustrated every time he loses, until he basically goes broke. Later on, there's a scene where him and the kid, as well as the two other guys, are camping along a river, and they're trying to catch food to eat, and failing. They keep trying different solutions, but none of them work. One of the solutions they try involved one of the side guys painting his face red to look like a fish (or maybe an octopus) in order to not scare the fish away as he dives into the river to catch one with his bare hands.

This is revealed in a flashback. \nThe two step brothers are being taught karate/martial arts when they are young. \nThe father is involved in some sort of illegal business/has a lot \u201cbad guys\u201d around him, but I don\u2019t remember exactly the nature of these criminal activities. \nThe movie ends with the two brothers fighting each other."}

Right after this, the movie goes to a villain in a lab surrounded by other men trying to cut a single strand of her hair. He first tries to cut it with a circular saw, but the blade snaps off and embeds itself in a man's leg. After this, the villain does something I can't remember that makes him able to cut the woman's hair with just a pair of scissors. It's a pretty useless scene to remember, I know, and it doesn't seem to be from the 1984 Supergirl!"}

{"id": "ggjup8", "title": "[TOMT] [TV MOVIE] (Late 80's-Early 90's) - Woman in Some Sort of Desert Town Falls in Love with a Native American Man who Can Turn Into a Crow & is a Spirit of Death", "description": "So when I was a preteen, I grew up in a very conservative home. Which meant that any chance I got, I would watch 'scandalous' made-for-tv-movies that I knew I wasn't supposed to watch. This particular film I must've watched in 1993 or 1994. It was obviously made for TV, and had a very Lifetime Original Movie feel, but I don't recall it feeling very old at the time, so I would put it's time period between the late 80's and early '90's.\n\nJust like the title says, this woman in a desert town that felt a lot like Arizona or New Mexico falls in love with this mysterious Native American dude. (Possibly an affair?) But he's actually like a death spirit, and turns into a crow whenever people die, and it's strongly implied that he is killing them. Like, his presence kills them...it's not a slasher film.\n\nThe woman has a friend who tries to warn her, but she of course doesn't listen even though she knows her friend is right, because the dude has some type of Don Juan charm over women as well. So I remember this specific scene of the woman getting home and checking her answering machine messages, and she hears her friend's voice say something like, \"I'm going to go talk to him! This is enough! He needs to let you go! I'm going to tell him to let you live your life!\" (I remember the live your life part verbatim.)\n\nSo the woman's like, Oh no my friend is going to die, and jumps in her car to go stop her. Camera cuts to the friend driving up near the fence to the dude's property, and this crow flies out and lands on the fence. And the camera does that 80's cut/cut/cut closer and closer to the bird's eye and we of course know that the friend is dead.\n\nNext scene we cut to the main woman's car and she's all angry driving up the same path to finally confront her lover. Next scene we see them in bed together.\n\nIt was super cheesey, but ten-year-old me was also super curious. I can't remember the ending, or if my parents came into the room and I had to turn it off really quick and never got to see the ending. Any help would be fantastic!\n\n* EDIT: Thanks to u/TippleFips, I'm remembering that the main woman I recall having a big blonde 80's hairdo, and also that dreamcatchers or some sort of hanging native charm decor playing a role.\n\n* EDIT 2: Okay, I've been searching all day and I'm remembering some other things. I think the villain is obsessed with our main character because he believes she is the embodiment of his lost love? And she might believe that the only way to get him to stop killing is to go away with him to the spirit world? There's something like that.\n\n* EDIT 3: This is getting more response than I\u2019ve gotten on here in the past, so I\u2019m gonna try to break it down further as all of you are helping me remember some things:\n\n* Blonde 30 somethings woman in current (1985?-1997?) New Mexico or Arizona starts an affair or very desire-filled relationship with a Native American dude that she knows she shouldn\u2019t be having. \n\n* Around the same time that she shows up, people in the town start dying, and the camera is always sure to show us the presence of a crow or raven at the death scenes that flies away. \n\n* At some point, the woman or her friend who rocks a large 80s black hair perm, starts to get suspicious. The friend goes to the town library or history or something and finds this story of a crow spirit or animal spirit that comes back every 300 years and takes the shape of a human (wendigo?) in order to find his lost soulmate and return with her to the afterlife. I THINK we as the audience are supposed to wonder if this dude really is this legend, or just thinks he is as an excuse to serial kill? But we also know...oh ya, this type of movie...it\u2019s true. All of it. \n\n* Wendigo dude has some type of dream catcher or Don Juan charm over the woman so every time she tries to break it off with him, they end up in bed. I remember an Aztec-patterned bedspread for some reason. \n\n* I specifically remember the friend leaving a voice message for the woman saying she was going to confront crow man, and her saying \u201cI\u2019m going to tell him to let you live your life!\u201d She drives over, dies, and the camera does a super dramatic pan into a crow\u2019s eye as the friend dies from like literally nothing. \n\n* The woman chases back after to save her friend and then ends up in bed again? But I think I turned it off because it was too scary and/or my ten-year-old Sunday school guilt got the better of me.\n\n* Although the entire aesthetic is Native American in nature, it is still very much a 90s paperback romance come to life and probably has a name like Deadly Lust.

Which meant that any chance I got, I would watch 'scandalous' made-for-tv-movies that I knew I wasn't supposed to watch. This particular film I must've watched in 1993 or 1994. It was obviously made for TV, and had a very Lifetime Original Movie feel, but I don't recall it feeling very old at the time, so I would put it's time period between the late 80's and early '90's.\n\nJust like the title says, this woman in a desert town that felt a lot like Arizona or New Mexico falls in love with this mysterious Native American dude. (Possibly an affair?) But he's actually like a death spirit, and turns into a crow whenever people die, and it's strongly implied that he is killing them. Like, his presence kills them...it's not a slasher film.\n\nThe woman has a friend who tries to warn her, but she of course doesn't listen even though she knows her friend is right, because the dude has some type of Don Juan charm over women as well. So I remember this specific scene of the woman getting home and checking her answering machine messages, and she hears her friend's voice say something like, \"I'm going to go talk to him! This is enough! He needs to let you go! I'm going to tell him to let you live your life!\" (I remember the live your life part verbatim.)\n\nSo the woman's like, Oh no my friend is going to die, and jumps in her car to go stop her. Camera cuts to the friend driving up near the fence to the dude's property, and this crow flies out and lands on the fence. And the camera does that 80's cut/cut/cut closer and closer to the bird's eye and we of course know that the friend is dead.\n\nNext scene we cut to the main woman's car and she's all angry driving up the same path to finally confront her lover. Next scene we see them in bed together.\n\nIt was super cheesey, but ten-year-old me was also super curious. I can't remember the ending, or if my parents came into the room and I had to turn it off really quick and never got to see the ending. Any help would be fantastic!\n\n* EDIT: Thanks to u/TippleFips, I'm remembering that the main woman I recall having a big blonde 80's hairdo, and also that dreamcatchers or some sort of hanging native charm decor playing a role.\n\n* EDIT 2: Okay, I've been searching all day and I'm remembering some other things. I think the villain is obsessed with our main character because he believes she is the embodiment of his lost love? And she might believe that the only way to get him to stop killing is to go away with him to the spirit world? There's something like that.\n\n* EDIT 3: This is getting more response than I\u2019ve gotten on here in the past, so I\u2019m gonna try to break it down further as all of you are helping me remember some things:\n\n* Blonde 30 somethings woman in current (1985?-1997?) New Mexico or Arizona starts an affair or very desire-filled relationship with a Native American dude that she knows she shouldn\u2019t be having. \n\n* Around the same time that she shows up, people in the town start dying, and the camera is always sure to show us the presence of a crow or raven at the death scenes that flies away. \n\n* At some point, the woman or her friend who rocks a large 80s black hair perm, starts to get suspicious. The friend goes to the town library or history or something and finds this story of a crow spirit or animal spirit that comes back every 300 years and takes the shape of a human (wendigo?) in order to find his lost soulmate and return with her to the afterlife. I THINK we as the audience are supposed to wonder if this dude really is this legend, or just thinks he is as an excuse to serial kill? But we also know...oh ya, this type of movie...it\u2019s true. All of it. \n\n* Wendigo dude has some type of dream catcher or Don Juan charm over the woman so every time she tries to break it off with him, they end up in bed. I remember an Aztec-patterned bedspread for some reason. \n\n* I specifically remember the friend leaving a voice message for the woman saying she was going to confront crow man, and her saying \u201cI\u2019m going to tell him to let you live your life!\u201d She drives over, dies, and the camera does a super dramatic pan into a crow\u2019s eye as the friend dies from like literally nothing. \n\n* The woman chases back after to save her friend and then ends up in bed again? But I think I turned it off because it was too scary and/or my ten-year-old Sunday school guilt got the better of me.\n\n* Although the entire aesthetic is Native American in nature, it is still very much a 90s paperback romance come to life and probably has a name like Deadly Lust. Think your aunt's house who lived in Arizona and had Pottery Barn dreamcatchers all over the backyard and cream-tone zig-zag pattern upholstery. That type of \"Native American.\"\n\nAND THIS HAS BEEN **SOLVED!!** By u/subhuman1 . It is a little film from 1994 with Suzanne Somers and a lovely 3.8/10 rating on IMDB that completely bastardizes and terribly repurposes all Native American symbology into one **SEDUCED BY EVIL**. Thank you all for your help and amazing guesses, THIS clip right here sums this movie up and why it was so difficult to find:\n\n[SEDUCED BY EVIL]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPbZim-wlG0 )"}

I came across a movie made by a young directing duo that was made for next to no money and released for free online. I would very much like to rediscover this film and the filmmakers behind it to see what they're up to now, but I can't for the life of me remember the name of the movie or the filmmakers. Here's all the information I can recall:  \n\n\n* It was written and directed primarily by two guys, one of whom played the role of the primary antagonist in the film.\n* At the time, the movie was available for free (on Vimeo, I believe) and probably still is. This was not released by some production company or on any distribution platforms, at least at that time.\n* The film was shot on one of the earlier DSLR cameras capable of recording video; it was probably a Canon 5D, 7D, T2i, or something similar.\n* In the behind-the-scenes, they said the camera had a dead pixel (that I believe can be seen throughout the movie).\n* Early in the movie (possibly the opening scene?) a tough kid and his heavily acne-covered friend stop at a gas station. In defense of his friend, the tough kid ends up punching someone to the ground and stepping on his neck or something similarly intimidating. If you think you've found the film, maybe scrub through the first few minutes for this scene.\n* The film is about a middle-aged man who owns a restaurant and has a typical American suburban upper-middle class life with a wife and a couple of kids. He owns a restaurant. While checking on the restaurant one morning, he is recognized by a tough twenty-something kid who happens to be eating at the restaurant along with his strange friend whose face is covered in irritated acne. The two follow the man back to his home, break in, and tie him to a chair at gunpoint (they also eventually bind and gag the wife and daughter, too, though I don't remember when this happens). They aren't there to steal anything. The tough kid forces the man to tell him the worst thing he's ever done. Spoilers: The man tearfully recounts how, during college, he forced himself onto a woman during a one-night stand. The tough kid then reveals that the woman became pregnant from that event, meaning the man is the tough kid's biological father. The tough kid has a black-and-white, absolutist view of morality that makes the man irredeemably evil in his eyes, and sees the home invasion and the threatening of the man's family as justice and payback for the life he never had. He begins to have a change of heart, though, when he watches his innocent little half-brother casually watch TV in another room, too young to comprehend what's going on. Meanwhile, the creepy, acne-faced kid gets the man's teenage daughter alone in her room. Her fate is not shown, but it's implied that acne kid has a history of sexual predation. I don't remember precisely how the film ends, but that should be enough plot info to go on.\n* I don't know for certain what year they uploaded the film, but it was likely circa 2010 to 2012.\n* I think the filmmakers ran an Indiegogo campaign to raise some modest funds for their second movie, but I don't know anything about that project.\n\nThanks.", "meta": {"author": "Slicktastico", "replies": [{"id": "g5uwhck", "body": "[Click here for a link to the answer!](/r/tipofmytongue/comments/ivqkuf/tomtmovie20102012_super_low_budget_home_invasion/g5tp0yl/)", "created_date": "2020-09-19T20:24:35+00:00", "author_name": "TipOfMyCircuitBoard", "replies": null}, {"id": "g5tp0yl", "body": "Bad is Bad (2011)?\n\nhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt1732563/reference", "created_date": "2020-09-19T15:22:17+00:00", "author_name": "udar55", "replies": [{"id": "g5uwgb4", "body": "Solved!

It would just be filmed from very far away and then got closer to the characters as it went on-eventually you could see their faces as you would in a normal film.\n\nThe garden guy is 30-something and he takes up photography as a hobby and urges his father to take him to the hospital where he was born because he wants to take pictures of it. His father takes him there, it's an abandoned hospital in the middle of nowhere, forests and fields around. He takes the pictures and then they go home.    \n\nNow that I think about it more it actually had multiple stories going on.

After washing out the cream stuff, they started blow drying. The main guy and his wife/girlfriend hold on to a hair, her arm rips where he's holding it.

The man is heavily bleeding in the head, but is with his full senses ...time passes by with the three arguing in the car, and, somehow(Don't remember how), this bleeding man makes up with the control of the car, leaving the previous man on the road(I don't know the fate of the woman). The following is the punchline, so if you think you haven't seen this movie, I recommend you not to read it, because it's quite cool:\n\n\nThe man wanders on the road until he sees a car approaching. They let him enter the car, in which there is a couple. When he hops in he recognizes the couple is himself and his couple, but in the past. He was the bleeding man."}

The villain changes his ways and protects the female character, thus becoming the hero. I think it had something to do with reincarnation and they've been fighting for a long time, etc. Not too sure about the main plot, so who knows.\n\nEDIT: The movie makes me think of Returner (2002) and Casshern (2004), but I'm sure it's neither of those two films. It must be the only Japanese film that I've seen with such a twist. "}

It's shot very well and is an excellent historical depiction of the airborne facet of the war (up until the twist).\n\nThe plane takes off for a routine nighttime bombing mission over Germany. The members of the crew are the main characters. We learn a little about each of them through dialogue. They're veterans and know each other well.

Morbid reality sets in as the crewmembers realize that they won't be able to land safely and will probably perish. They have two options: wait until they run out of fuel and plunge to their deaths in the icy Channel, or try to survive a crash landing. They deliberate and choose to attempt a landing.\n\n\nEarlier in the film, the tail gunner of the plane is shown to posess a silly cartoonish drawing of a red biplane with giant rounded yellow wheels. It's his good luck charm for protection. He either has it taped up on the wall or carries it in his wallet on every mission. He's marketed to the audience as the most likeable member of the crew. He's an artistic, good natured guy who wants nothing more than the war to end. He is seen looking at his drawing in the beginning, but it isn't assumed to be significant at the time.\n\nThe plane begins descending to land and tension builds as the crew silently pray for their survival. In spectacular deus-ex-machina fashion, a 2D animated inflatable yellow wheel with a red patch on it sparkles into existence where the stuck landing gear is supposed to be. Remarkably, it's the same wheel as the ones on the tail-gunner's cartoon drawing. Disney magic saves the day, and the plane lands safely.

It was a sad ending, I guess?\n\nLastly, if I remember correctly, the poster or the cover of the DVD I think, had a woman in an open chest with the dismembered limbs in it, her one arm feels like crawling out or something like that.\n\nThat's all I remember from here. Everything's vague.\n\nI really wanted to know what that movie is about because it's been bothering me like I'm itching to find out the ending or something.\n\nCan someone help me find the title or at least the link for this movie? I appreciate the help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLink to the previous OP:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/kgpr1g/tomt\\_movie\\_i\\_cant\\_remember\\_the\\_title\\_of\\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/kgpr1g/tomt_movie_i_cant_remember_the_title_of_this/)"}

{"id": "k4uz7c", "title": "[TOMT][MOVIE][80/90s] A movie about a guy with a black nail and two siblings?", "description": "Ok, there is this movie I saw when I was a kid. It was in the early 90's although I cannot assure the movie was filmed in the 90's, it could be in the late 80's also. I was a kid, and at that time I didn't know a word of English (not my native language). It was a subtitled VHS movie my parent's friends rented for a weekend and we were visiting them .. but none of them remember at this time which movie it was. I have some flashes of the movie and after 30 years still have no clue.. so, here some flashes that could help to find out:\n\n 1) The movie started with a young woman (dark hair, brunette) going to her recently past father's house in order to pick some things (I guess). She goes to her fathers room, suddenly a coin falls to the floor and gets between two wooded tiles on the floor .. that event triggers some device that makes the bed move and opens a door under her father's bed where I believe she finds some kind of 'treasure' her father was hidding (mostly arms if my memory is approximate after so many years).\n\n2) The women is driving a convertible in the desert (maybe Route 66?) and at some point she reaches a truck on the road traveling in the same direction. She gets under the truck with her car and drives under the truck kind of 'hiding'. ( the convertible was low enough to fit under the truck)\n\n3) There was a weird guy with a black nail along the movie, was like a villain or something. I don't know why but the detail of the 'black nail' was relevant in the plot. The guy aspect was similar to Edward Scissorhands, or at least that's how I stored that memory in my mind. Don't forget I was 4/5 and it was around 30 years ago.\n\n4) The lady's brother was some kind of martial arts guy, and he is forced to fight with his girlfriend to death to a certain point in the movie (I believe in the end) and he dies if I remember correctly. It was some kind of 'fight club' and the the 'black nail' guy had something to do with it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThose are all the details I remember, I search about that movie all over the internet in the last 20 years at least once a year and never ever got at least a breadcrumb ..

It was in the early 90's although I cannot assure the movie was filmed in the 90's, it could be in the late 80's also. I was a kid, and at that time I didn't know a word of English (not my native language). It was a subtitled VHS movie my parent's friends rented for a weekend and we were visiting them .. but none of them remember at this time which movie it was. I have some flashes of the movie and after 30 years still have no clue.. so, here some flashes that could help to find out:\n\n 1) The movie started with a young woman (dark hair, brunette) going to her recently past father's house in order to pick some things (I guess). She goes to her fathers room, suddenly a coin falls to the floor and gets between two wooded tiles on the floor .. that event triggers some device that makes the bed move and opens a door under her father's bed where I believe she finds some kind of 'treasure' her father was hidding (mostly arms if my memory is approximate after so many years).\n\n2) The women is driving a convertible in the desert (maybe Route 66?) and at some point she reaches a truck on the road traveling in the same direction. She gets under the truck with her car and drives under the truck kind of 'hiding'. ( the convertible was low enough to fit under the truck)\n\n3) There was a weird guy with a black nail along the movie, was like a villain or something. I don't know why but the detail of the 'black nail' was relevant in the plot. The guy aspect was similar to Edward Scissorhands, or at least that's how I stored that memory in my mind. Don't forget I was 4/5 and it was around 30 years ago.\n\n4) The lady's brother was some kind of martial arts guy, and he is forced to fight with his girlfriend to death to a certain point in the movie (I believe in the end) and he dies if I remember correctly. It was some kind of 'fight club' and the the 'black nail' guy had something to do with it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThose are all the details I remember, I search about that movie all over the internet in the last 20 years at least once a year and never ever got at least a breadcrumb .. I hope I'm posting this in the right place! found this sub today, maybe someone can help ... Thanks!"}

It was not a big heist, just a simple robbery.

{"id": "hpgh6e", "title": "[TOMT][MOVIE][2010s] A french movie about a boy whose father is a spy going to south France with a thief who was seeking revenge on him.", "description": "First of all, sorry for my shitty English. This is all of the information I have. So, back then me and my class went to a cinema to watch some movies from around the word(probably a film festival). And one of the movies caught my attention.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was about a boy named Nono (YES, I remember his name for some reason). His father was a spy and his stepmother wasn't. There was a scene where some other kid did a presentation (or conference I don't know) while Nono was thinking about impressing people. So he gets on the roof trying to descend with an umbrella. Nono however fails descending and instead causes chaos. Then his dad punishes him and his dad gets in an argument with his wife for some reason.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLater, Nono's dad sents him to a ride to South France for some reason and he meets his psychiatrist or something who was an old man. The old man talks with about how troubled he was back then and after that the boy went to sit somewhere else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter a long ride Nono goes to a farm and gets attacked by other spies. After that another spy comes to defend him and shoots up the other spies. Nono then realizes that he was an infamous thief named \"Felix\" (which I don't remember his surname). The reason why he was so infamous was because after robbing places around the world, he left a necklace with a thunder. Who ironically he got caught by his dad and got arrested.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen the duo arrive at South France. They we're talking about spy stuff and become good friends. In the next morning, Nono goes out for the walk and then suddenly he remembers that Felix after he got arrested by his dad, said to him that he will be seeking revenge on his son. Nono escapes from him and meets a pop star(which I don't remember her name AGAIN). The pop star said she was close friends with his real mother so they go out to Nono's old house. The pop star told about his mother's backstory that she got in an argument with his father about moving out from his house and how she died. Nono's REAL mother tried to do a big jump with a horse between two cliffs. She failed to jump between them and died.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn halfway of the movie, Nono calls his stepmother and she tells she divorced with his dad and took a train to her gramma's house. Nono then hurries to a train to get her with his dad along. He meets his dad in a same train so they both rush to her.

This is all of the information I have. So, back then me and my class went to a cinema to watch some movies from around the word(probably a film festival). And one of the movies caught my attention.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was about a boy named Nono (YES, I remember his name for some reason). His father was a spy and his stepmother wasn't. There was a scene where some other kid did a presentation (or conference I don't know) while Nono was thinking about impressing people. So he gets on the roof trying to descend with an umbrella. Nono however fails descending and instead causes chaos. Then his dad punishes him and his dad gets in an argument with his wife for some reason.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLater, Nono's dad sents him to a ride to South France for some reason and he meets his psychiatrist or something who was an old man. The old man talks with about how troubled he was back then and after that the boy went to sit somewhere else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter a long ride Nono goes to a farm and gets attacked by other spies. After that another spy comes to defend him and shoots up the other spies. Nono then realizes that he was an infamous thief named \"Felix\" (which I don't remember his surname). The reason why he was so infamous was because after robbing places around the world, he left a necklace with a thunder. Who ironically he got caught by his dad and got arrested.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen the duo arrive at South France. They we're talking about spy stuff and become good friends. In the next morning, Nono goes out for the walk and then suddenly he remembers that Felix after he got arrested by his dad, said to him that he will be seeking revenge on his son. Nono escapes from him and meets a pop star(which I don't remember her name AGAIN). The pop star said she was close friends with his real mother so they go out to Nono's old house. The pop star told about his mother's backstory that she got in an argument with his father about moving out from his house and how she died. Nono's REAL mother tried to do a big jump with a horse between two cliffs. She failed to jump between them and died.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn halfway of the movie, Nono calls his stepmother and she tells she divorced with his dad and took a train to her gramma's house. Nono then hurries to a train to get her with his dad along. He meets his dad in a same train so they both rush to her. After some talking, Nono's dad puts one handcuff on his stepmother's hand and one on his other. His dad proposes to her saying \"Do you want to start all over again ?\" in french and she agreed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe movie ends with Nono finishing the story in front of the people he met along in his adventures. The crowd applause to him and with a kid that I mentioned back then being jealous.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI believe the movies 90 or 100 minutes long and genres were Comedy,Drama,Action and Family (which I don't really think deserves to be called a Family movie because of the shooting scene I mentioned)."}

{"id": "ai3dgk", "title": "[TOMT] [Movie] A guy drives his bosses daughter cross country in a box truck and falls in love", "description": "As is the running trend when I come here seeking answers, I remember most of this movie, except for the title. lets get to it:\n\nEDIT: The film came out in the late 2000's/ early 2010's\n\nTL;DR (because goodness this needs one): A young guy drives his bosses daughter cross country. Hijinx ensue. They fall in love. in the end it was all orchestrated by the boss to teach the male lead to live a life outside of his career, as was his mistake in life. a happy ending.\n\nThe movie starts and a young guy that works at some company or another is leaving the office at the end of the day and forgets something on his desk and leaves his shoe to hold the elevator door open while he runs to get it. When he gets back to the elevator his boss is there, he gives him a special assignment, and goes down in the elevator by himself, taking the male lead's shoe with him. \n\nThe next day the male lead shows up at a house and is told he's being tasked with driving a box truck across country, which contains a single, large, wooden crate. Accompanying him is his boss's daughter, whom is going to school somewhere on the opposite coast from where  they start. The male lead and the daughter clash and neither initially likes each other at all. They stop at a truck stop and the daughter insists on getting one of those huge 82 ounce refillable soda fountain bottles. \n\nAlong the way they pick up a hitchhiker (at the behest of the daughter) who, to the chagrin of the male lead, share way too much about his personal life. they stop at a roadside restaurant, and in the bathroom, the hitchhiker more or less makes the male lead pop a huge pimple on his back (which he refers to as a \"bimple\" aka a back pimple) and after doing so, which naturally makes a big mess, a biker walks in on the scene and quickly decides to leave the two alone to their \"business\", thinking they were gay lovers. while the hitchhiker gets redressed, the male lead exits the bathroom and convinces the daughter that they hitchhiker had decided to leaver their company, but in reality the male lead was ditching him. \n\nAfter that everything gets kinda fuzzy for me. I know that in some part they end up at a house party put on by the daughters friends, and the male lead somehow comes under the influence and the daughter takes care of him. At another point the two of them get into a fight and they part ways and they are both mad at each other. The hitchhiker guy makes a reappearance. They realize that they have feeling for each other and they reunite, and he delivers her to her house on the opposite coast, where her father is waiting.\n\nin the climax, the male lead opens the crate in the back of the truck, only to discover that, aside from the squeeky mass of packing peanuts, the only thing inside is the shoe that he left in the elevator door and his boss took at the beginning of the film.

Hijinx ensue. They fall in love. in the end it was all orchestrated by the boss to teach the male lead to live a life outside of his career, as was his mistake in life. a happy ending.\n\nThe movie starts and a young guy that works at some company or another is leaving the office at the end of the day and forgets something on his desk and leaves his shoe to hold the elevator door open while he runs to get it. When he gets back to the elevator his boss is there, he gives him a special assignment, and goes down in the elevator by himself, taking the male lead's shoe with him. \n\nThe next day the male lead shows up at a house and is told he's being tasked with driving a box truck across country, which contains a single, large, wooden crate. Accompanying him is his boss's daughter, whom is going to school somewhere on the opposite coast from where  they start. The male lead and the daughter clash and neither initially likes each other at all. They stop at a truck stop and the daughter insists on getting one of those huge 82 ounce refillable soda fountain bottles. \n\nAlong the way they pick up a hitchhiker (at the behest of the daughter) who, to the chagrin of the male lead, share way too much about his personal life. they stop at a roadside restaurant, and in the bathroom, the hitchhiker more or less makes the male lead pop a huge pimple on his back (which he refers to as a \"bimple\" aka a back pimple) and after doing so, which naturally makes a big mess, a biker walks in on the scene and quickly decides to leave the two alone to their \"business\", thinking they were gay lovers. while the hitchhiker gets redressed, the male lead exits the bathroom and convinces the daughter that they hitchhiker had decided to leaver their company, but in reality the male lead was ditching him. \n\nAfter that everything gets kinda fuzzy for me. I know that in some part they end up at a house party put on by the daughters friends, and the male lead somehow comes under the influence and the daughter takes care of him. At another point the two of them get into a fight and they part ways and they are both mad at each other. The hitchhiker guy makes a reappearance. They realize that they have feeling for each other and they reunite, and he delivers her to her house on the opposite coast, where her father is waiting.\n\nin the climax, the male lead opens the crate in the back of the truck, only to discover that, aside from the squeeky mass of packing peanuts, the only thing inside is the shoe that he left in the elevator door and his boss took at the beginning of the film. Somehow the whole thing was supposed to teach the male lead not to spend his entire life working, as his boss had, and to live for things outside of advancing his career, which the boss had done and which was why he and his daughter are so distant. I believe that the male lead gets the fathers blessing to continue seeing his daughter, as they make each other happy, and its all a happy ending. The male lead and the daughter end up together, lead gets a promotion, and they begin a family, I think. \n\nThank You in advance!"}

I saw this movie on TV years ago when I was little. (Maybe 9 or 10 years old) My memory is fuzzy and I only remember bits and pieces of it but it was an old movie that looked like it was from the 70s or 80s about an alien life form that comes to Earth and kills people and the only way it can survive somehow is by taking the heads of it's victims and putting it on it's body. \n\nI remember one scene in particular that scared the hell out of me where the guy wakes up in the middle of the night with his dog barking outside. He goes to check and all of a sudden, the barking stops. He looks outside through the window and doesn't see his dog anywhere. He turns around and you see this human body with the head of his dog right in front of him. Shit scarred me for life. There's another scene where I think he gets the head of a homeless guy and it just looks weird...\n\nThat's about all I can remember...again, this was on TV at like 2 or 3 in the morning. Can't recall the television station but it might have been USA Network or TNT or some such. I swear it wasn't a fever dream I had and the movie is real, but without a title, I've had a hard time searching for it online."}

So to avoid being used he pretends to fall in love with one of the women there? \nThat\u2019s all I remember and I\u2019ve been trying to find this movie whenever I think of it for the past like three years."}

The clip they used depicted a skinny, bald Kevin Spacey looking guy in an interrogation room who looks rather distraught, and is most likely a detective of some sort. Behind him there is a black haired woman with a white top and khaki colored skirt on standing next to a guy who were a military-esque uniform, who is leading her to a table in the room.

{"id": "dhe5ph", "title": "[TOMT] [Kids TV Show] - A stop-motion preschool show similar to a fusion of Gumby and Dora the Explorer, only probably less annoying and more obscure. Has existed since before 2006- 2007 at the very least.", "description": "When I was about five or six, my family had Mediacom's On Demand service alongside our regular cable programs. Sometimes to keep me entertained, my father would put on a couple two or three shows for me to watch. I can cleary name two of these shows; Postman Pat and Rainbow Fish. However, the name of the third show has completely evaded my mind, even though I can clearly remember what it looks like.\n\nIt has similarities to Gumby in that it's a stop-motion cartoon targeted at young children and that it has two protagonists who fill a similar role to Gumby and Pokey, with a bit of Dora the Explorer's formula sprinkled in as these two characters would go on an adventure to solve a problem each episode and often called upon a friend(s) to help them out. This show's helper friend, I believe, was a sentient red pick-up truck who either helped lift things or would deliver items to the protagonists. It was a red work-vehicle of some kind, that much I know.\n\nWith the main characters, I can only clearly describe one of them in detail. It was a boy character that you could possibly mistake for a girl without context since his voice actor was either a child or a woman. His design was very simple, as it pretty much consisted of a tennis ball-colored head, a light pink body (that can be mistaken for a dress), limbs with the same tennis ball color, and curly red hair that was either just a bundle of curled thread or a clay-like substance. His partner was a reddish animal, similar to Pokey, but I'm pretty sure he wasn't a horse.\n\nI believe each episode started in what clearly looked like a kitchen counter where the characters would hang out and find their problem for the episode. One episode started with the girlish-boy talking to his animal friend about how they were out in \"the great outdoors\" when it was obvious that their location was anything BUT outdoors. It was an environment where miscellaneous everyday items were utilized for other purposes like landscapes and platforms. As the episode progressed, the characters would transition to different environments, though the only other one I can clearly remember was a pine forest that may or may not have had a log cabin in the distance and where the vehicle-character may or may not have gotten stuck in as a part of one episode's main problem. That's also the only other episode I can remember; The problem was basically the vehicle-character got stuck somewhere and couldn't get unstuck, so the main characters have to go out and find a way to help their friend. When they tried to call for him as per the formula, they realize that \"Oh wait, our friend is stuck and can't possibly help us right now!\" Then there was one episode that ended with the main characters and a monkey-like character called \"The Queen\" or whatever doing handstands. The green character rubbed his eyes in disbelief when he first met the monkey.\n\nI'm not sure if it was all purely claymation or just stop-motion with poseable figures and little items. I first watched the cartoon back in 2006 or 2007, so that should give you a timeframe maximum of sorts. This is literally all I can remember of the show and I hope it's more than enough to find the answer.", "meta": {"author": "Catgrace01", "replies": [{"id": "f3mn2i2", "body": "A", "created_date": "2019-10-13T18:12:07+00:00", "author_name": "Catgrace01", "replies": null}, {"id": "f3n342s", "body": "any of these it?  \n [https://www.ranker.com/list/clay-animation-tv-shows-and-series/reference](https://www.ranker.com/list/clay-animation-tv-shows-and-series/reference)", "created_date": "2019-10-13T19:21:00+00:00", "author_name": "lexa_bear42", "replies": null}, {"id": "f3nxg9k", "body": "That\u2019s the animated version of I Spy\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Spy_(2003_TV_series)", "created_date": "2019-10-13T21:53:16+00:00", "author_name": "SirDoris", "replies": [{"id": "f3q1wro", "body": "That's it!

One episode started with the girlish-boy talking to his animal friend about how they were out in \"the great outdoors\" when it was obvious that their location was anything BUT outdoors. It was an environment where miscellaneous everyday items were utilized for other purposes like landscapes and platforms. As the episode progressed, the characters would transition to different environments, though the only other one I can clearly remember was a pine forest that may or may not have had a log cabin in the distance and where the vehicle-character may or may not have gotten stuck in as a part of one episode's main problem. That's also the only other episode I can remember; The problem was basically the vehicle-character got stuck somewhere and couldn't get unstuck, so the main characters have to go out and find a way to help their friend. When they tried to call for him as per the formula, they realize that \"Oh wait, our friend is stuck and can't possibly help us right now!\" Then there was one episode that ended with the main characters and a monkey-like character called \"The Queen\" or whatever doing handstands. The green character rubbed his eyes in disbelief when he first met the monkey.\n\nI'm not sure if it was all purely claymation or just stop-motion with poseable figures and little items. I first watched the cartoon back in 2006 or 2007, so that should give you a timeframe maximum of sorts. This is literally all I can remember of the show and I hope it's more than enough to find the answer."}

She decides to meet a guy from the internet and the whole group follows her because they worried about her.

I don't know what he did for work exactly but it was manual labour and my vague recollection of the way the woman dressed makes me think of a governess or something like that - dark floor length skirt & white blouse, that sort of thing.\n\nI remember him staying up all night practicing writing on a small blackboard. There was a scene where they were walking down a street she pulled him under an archway and kissed him and he got super embarrassed/uncomfortable because they weren't married yet and they were in public (or that's the explanation my grandfather gave when I asked him it might have been slightly different in the actual film). She was definitely 'modern' or a bit more outspoken than was normal for the time because they clashed a lot initially.\n\nThese are the only two characters I remember in the whole film so I don't think there was a big cast.\n\nI realise this isn't a huge amount to go on but it's a film that's stuck in my mind for at least 20 years so I'd love to be able to see it again and can't ask him about it.

It was a black and white film and probably (though not certainly) British.\n\nThe plot is something like a working class man is taught to read/write by a (possibly middle class?) woman and eventually they fall in love. I don't know what he did for work exactly but it was manual labour and my vague recollection of the way the woman dressed makes me think of a governess or something like that - dark floor length skirt & white blouse, that sort of thing.\n\nI remember him staying up all night practicing writing on a small blackboard. There was a scene where they were walking down a street she pulled him under an archway and kissed him and he got super embarrassed/uncomfortable because they weren't married yet and they were in public (or that's the explanation my grandfather gave when I asked him it might have been slightly different in the actual film). She was definitely 'modern' or a bit more outspoken than was normal for the time because they clashed a lot initially.\n\nThese are the only two characters I remember in the whole film so I don't think there was a big cast.\n\nI realise this isn't a huge amount to go on but it's a film that's stuck in my mind for at least 20 years so I'd love to be able to see it again and can't ask him about it.

{"id": "6w70m3", "title": "[TOMT][MOVIE] A horror movie from the 90s or early 00s. People trapped in building, pursued by huge white/purple ghost. Two survive on a balcony", "description": "I only saw a few scenes of this film, mostly towards the end, with several pauses in between. I have absolutely no idea of the plot.\n\nIt was at the very least 9 years ago, but more likely it was about 15 years ago. I\u00b4m not good at estimating time.\n\n\n\nTHE GHOST\n\nI *assume* it was a ghost, but I\u00b4m not fully sure about it.\n\nThe ghost was huge (or, at least, it generally seemed to occupy all the available space between walls and between floor and ceiling, which sometimes was quite a lot), a mix of strong white, black and purple colors. I think it sometimes looked sort of like a woman with a lost of \"ghost aura\", and sometimes it simply looked like a formless mass of white and purple. It wasn\u00b4t one of those blurry ghosts that look like vapor or they\u00b4re only half on this world. This one looked rather like a... sort of... mess of white, black and purple colored glass pieces thrown into a blender that were being constantly blended at a rather fast speed.\n\nIt pursued the people. I think it didn\u00b4t actively \"do\" anything else than moving: it simply engulfed people and they died screaming.\n\nI don\u00b4t remember the ghost being able to go through walls, and it might be that the people blocked it temporarily simply by closing a door behind them. This could be completely wrong, though. What I\u00b4m sure about is that the ghost wasn\u00b4t constantly pursuing them, but that the people did manage to lose it or somehow stop the persecution at some point or every now and then. I remember some men in a corridor and then the ghost shows up around a corner, and the men say something like *Not again!*.\n\n\n\nTHE PEOPLE\n\nThere were a bunch of people, both men and women, in the building. By this point they had split into a few small groups. There were at least 6 people alive in the building by the end of the movie, so likely they were a bunch more at the beginning.\n\nA couple of them (two women?) were trapped somewhere with what seemed to be either a morgue or an oven. A (black?) metal structure with maybe one maybe several square-ish doors occupied part of a wall. There might have been someone else in there, maybe a dead or unconscious man, but I\u00b4m not sure. I do remember the women being very distressed, crying and screaming. Maybe fighting with each other.\n\nThe rest generally tried to get out of the way of the ghost and find a way out of the building. I think I remember some scenes where some of them were just sitting against a wall, catching their breath, while others urged them to get up and keep moving.\n\n\n\nTHE BUILDING\n\nI remember very little, but I\u00b4d say it was sort of like an old, VERY tall house. Maybe a lighthouse? It had a lot of wood parts inside and I think lots of stairs. I\u00b4d say it might have been built between the late 1800s and early 1900s, and it generally looked like a countryside house. Maybe.\n\nI only remember one scene where I saw the exterior: the last scene.\n\n\n\nTHE LAST SCENE(s)\n\nAfter some calm moments, the ghost shows up again and starts pursuing the people. Killed some, and only two (two men, I think) reached and opened a door into the light of day and closed it behind them.\n\nThe camera starts at the bottom of the building and goes up, and up, and up, until it finds them. They\u00b4re sitting on some sort of balcony (I don\u00b4t remember it having any security bar, though. Just a wooden platform sticking out of the building), feet dangling. \n\nThe house was white, I think. Old, dirty white. I remember it having a square or rectangular base, but it might have been round.

I have absolutely no idea of the plot.\n\nIt was at the very least 9 years ago, but more likely it was about 15 years ago. I\u00b4m not good at estimating time.\n\n\n\nTHE GHOST\n\nI *assume* it was a ghost, but I\u00b4m not fully sure about it.\n\nThe ghost was huge (or, at least, it generally seemed to occupy all the available space between walls and between floor and ceiling, which sometimes was quite a lot), a mix of strong white, black and purple colors. I think it sometimes looked sort of like a woman with a lost of \"ghost aura\", and sometimes it simply looked like a formless mass of white and purple. It wasn\u00b4t one of those blurry ghosts that look like vapor or they\u00b4re only half on this world. This one looked rather like a... sort of... mess of white, black and purple colored glass pieces thrown into a blender that were being constantly blended at a rather fast speed.\n\nIt pursued the people. I think it didn\u00b4t actively \"do\" anything else than moving: it simply engulfed people and they died screaming.\n\nI don\u00b4t remember the ghost being able to go through walls, and it might be that the people blocked it temporarily simply by closing a door behind them. This could be completely wrong, though. What I\u00b4m sure about is that the ghost wasn\u00b4t constantly pursuing them, but that the people did manage to lose it or somehow stop the persecution at some point or every now and then. I remember some men in a corridor and then the ghost shows up around a corner, and the men say something like *Not again!*.\n\n\n\nTHE PEOPLE\n\nThere were a bunch of people, both men and women, in the building. By this point they had split into a few small groups. There were at least 6 people alive in the building by the end of the movie, so likely they were a bunch more at the beginning.\n\nA couple of them (two women?) were trapped somewhere with what seemed to be either a morgue or an oven. A (black?) metal structure with maybe one maybe several square-ish doors occupied part of a wall. There might have been someone else in there, maybe a dead or unconscious man, but I\u00b4m not sure. I do remember the women being very distressed, crying and screaming. Maybe fighting with each other.\n\nThe rest generally tried to get out of the way of the ghost and find a way out of the building. I think I remember some scenes where some of them were just sitting against a wall, catching their breath, while others urged them to get up and keep moving.\n\n\n\nTHE BUILDING\n\nI remember very little, but I\u00b4d say it was sort of like an old, VERY tall house. Maybe a lighthouse? It had a lot of wood parts inside and I think lots of stairs. I\u00b4d say it might have been built between the late 1800s and early 1900s, and it generally looked like a countryside house. Maybe.\n\nI only remember one scene where I saw the exterior: the last scene.\n\n\n\nTHE LAST SCENE(s)\n\nAfter some calm moments, the ghost shows up again and starts pursuing the people. Killed some, and only two (two men, I think) reached and opened a door into the light of day and closed it behind them.\n\nThe camera starts at the bottom of the building and goes up, and up, and up, until it finds them. They\u00b4re sitting on some sort of balcony (I don\u00b4t remember it having any security bar, though. Just a wooden platform sticking out of the building), feet dangling. \n\nThe house was white, I think. Old, dirty white. I remember it having a square or rectangular base, but it might have been round. I think it didn\u00b4t have many windows and they were generally small.\n\nThe survivors seem to have been there for a little while. They have caught their breath and are relaxing and joking around a little. Then they notice the Sun is starting to set behind the horizon, and understand that they\u00b4re in a very bad situation.\n\n\n\nTHE LAST SCENE, ALTERNATIVE\n\nIt could be that first we saw the men relaxing a little on the balcony, and *then*, after they noticed the Sun was coming down and that they were on a bad spot, the camera pans out and then you see how high above the ground they are sitting, with no means to climb down the smooth exterior wall.\n\n\nAnd that\u00b4s about it.\n\n\nThanks!\n\nEDIT: Trying to fix the formatting"}

Some kind of horrible monsters were chasing his car and he managed to drive away and escape, if i remember correctly he manages to save himself but when hes rescued he's later speaking with some people and they tell him that it was probably some kind of nightmare and nobody believes his story.
